Now the app says my card was declined, and that I need to update info or risk losing the reservation. Since it wasn't booking the one that took the money, I don't want to do this so they don't bill me twice. I contacted customer service chat, no response after 24h. Horrible. EDIT: Had to call customer service, they told me I must update so the reservation is not autocancelled.",

Instead, I get the forecast and weather alerts for the city proper, which is 30 miles south and often dramatically different. I keep waiting to see if they'll fix it, but I'm about to give up.",

In a stable light it has a stable interval where the color of the picture changes every half a sec from warm to a bit more natural. That is like flipping a coin on the light. Not great. And right after taking the picture and double tap on it to zoom in on details like a face, after few sec it zooms out on its own. Annoying. And the picture seems to be grainy and isn't capturing light reflections very well. Overall not all that good.",

I found short stories I was interested in, only to find out you must subscribe to actually read them and have access to them. Which comes at a very hefty cost.",

This rate is usually much higher than the standard exchange rate, meaning the final amount charged to your card can be significantly more than the price originally quoted at booking. Juding by other reviews, these sharp practices are not uncommon on Agoda. Thankfully, I realised and cancelled the booking.",

After hours of calls with support, they said the agency canceled it and only refunded my money with a $15 coupon. I was forced to pay $200 more because in Dubai, the closer you get to check-in day, hotel prices go much higher. Agoda has very weak support and uses unreliable third-party agencies. who compensate me financial and emotional damage?! Not recommended at all.",

I block the number every time I get a call. This hasn't helped at all, they just use a new number. They don't give good advice, they just push for a higher cost subscription package.",

Don't fall for the last chance to get 300$ credit if you reactivate your ads.. I did it on the 27th by the first they hit me with a 60$ charge. And you can't get no one on the phone to help you get it fixed.. then the leeds you get seem fake because you get a request for a job and reply right away, and then you don't get any responses.",

Even their premium membership only gets you 26 comics for the entire month. The comics are so short you could finish that in an hour. Such a disappointment",

I was hoping there would be a feature where when a chapter costs gems, there would be a coin cost too. The coin cost can be way more than the gem cost, I would say about 1000-3000 maybe? I have a lot of coins that I don't use so I think it would be great for me to finally have a use for them. Of course, you don't have to agree but I'm just suggesting some ideas. Overall, I love this app!",

To be fair, considering that this is a free app with free comics, the grammatical error filled translations are expected, and the below-average, nothing-special comics (with a few gems, I must admit) are not necessarily unappealing if one is into mindless, harmless comics. The app itself is very easy to navigate with large features and quick, smooth transitions. I honestly think the app itself, disregarding the stories, is quite advanced and probably makes up for its large range of nothings. TL;DR: Decent, mostly bad stories, but nice features.",

Changing chapters is a little tedious though. When you tap the screen in the comments section (cause you know you're gonna read some comments), the page will oftentimes move up or down instead of showing the tap at top or bottom. A side swipe feature to change the chapter like turning a page would be more beneficial and sleek. As for the coin thing, I don't understand the purpose.

So, it's very difficult to read more than one or two chapters of a comic a day without spending money. This was my favorite comic app but is no longer and I'm going to delete it. 🙃 ~CharlieYT",

Nice exercise progressive overload settings with the ability to recommend target weight as pct of 1 rep max and ability to use pyramid sets.

Also, the pop-ups and list don't sync. So, if I delete a to do on the list in the app, the pop-up remains. I'd also like to be able to remove a batch of to dos at once.

It has stopped notifying me when a task is due. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, and it works for one day and then stops again. I need an app that notifies me.

Then you will lose any type of reoccurring tasks.   Love the sub task concept, really slick but if you cannot keep them in sync it does not work very well.   Another item that does not work, though I have requested it is that face that landscape mode is not coded for in all of the app, again in both the web and app version, makes it difficult to use on a tablet if you are switching to a keyboard for example.   So because of syncing issues, missing key landscape issues in several places in the app, lose of data due to syncing issues I had to uninstall the app. Lucky for me I am using 2 or 3 to do list so I have my primary one I am still using, so nothing lost except time. Though I was really hoping this one would pan out.

You lose the extra stuff which means you are stuck at the same level unless you spend coins to get more moves. Not fun anymore.",

The only reason it is a 3 is because you need to keep from losing in order to keep the cat rewards. Levels are too hard without it (hard levels). Spent $200, just to get through the car episode. Can't afford to play so having to uninstall. Not fun repeating levels endlessly with 5 lives only.",

Also, bring back mini games, and give us more options for the decor because it seems like we have less choicea each time. There are various things I'd personally want to change. Please don't let this game go down the drain like others. I've had it for years and I love it, but it does need some improvement in certain areas.",
