Payments can be set to pay later, which is helpful. Regular payees appear at top of the list, too.",

Videos are recorded at a constant fps (frames per second), and the shutter speed keeps a lens open for a specific duration to capture a single frame, therefore shutter speed can't be used in video as it would brake the fps.",

They merged the best of both worlds. The subscription price seems reasonable and fair to me. Please add a option for \"focus peaking\", choose bitrate in video Settings. Increase the quality of panoramic photographs a little more🔝 (sometimes you lose details in landscape photos for example) and hide the navigation bar. That's all🙏 Great job guys! ⭐⭐⭐⭐",

        "content": "The new updated maps doesnt work when im driving a truck when its on the seat, only when its upright on the phone holder. I have the same issues on different phones so its definitely something to do with the update. It works fine in any position when i use it in my car. With the old software it works fine. I deleted cache and other data but problem persists and its been going on for months. Please can you fix this issue. Thanks",

If I was programming, then I would do force audio high option as well as I would do extra volume level (value) separately to override other volume control and that will make many people happier.",

No more links to where the AI obtained its data, so one cannot verify accuracy!! Major major fail! Voices annoying. A total step backwards. The update is a dumbing down of the entire AI experience! Unintuitive way to try find history. Plugins gone! No ability to search by images. I was one of the first adopters of AI and Copilot. Uninstalling till they get it right.",

If you just wait for 10 seconds on this screen, it'll lower the price to ~$30 per year. HOWEVER, there's a catch. This offer only lasts 2 minutes. It'll put a 2 minute timer on the screen to pressure you into buying before the deal goes away. No ty for now!",

It is helping me keep on a exercise regimen, which with multiple kids its hard to remember you stuff everyday. I have yet to purchase the ad free version because I don't need to! Yes there are ads but placed in reasonable spots and not overly annoying. The ad's don't pop up during the workout. This app is a 10/10 in my opinion!!",

The workout is different everyday, so its nice how it's different. You can also do other workouts besides just your daily one if you want. For those extra workouts, you can choose to do beginner, intermediate, or advanced. It shows you an animation of the workout is supposed to look like, so you actually do it right. I recommend to any level.",

I like that it lets you adjust the difficulty if it's too easy or too hard and I LOVE the fact that it lets you replace some moves if you can't do them (I live in a small apartment above some people so I can't do anything with jumping or anything that takes up too much floor space). Honestly the only thing about it is that the water reminder doesn't exactly work well, but other than that 👍",

Walk daily for minimum of 30 minutes (for me about a mile and a half in that time) and do this app everyday before bed. Works for me and have a few friends and strangers now using it. I personally recommend this as I have seen great results by what I listed here 😊 good luck ladies! ❤️💪🏻",

I'm over 500 levels in and not seen anything remotely similar to the \"stop the screen filling\" gameplay they show in the ads: it's just another \"match 3\" clone. On the plus side, it is ad free, and you can absolutely play it without spending a penny on microtransactions; just that it's nothing remotely new. It's not bad, it's just... more of the same - and honestly, they really should be fined for false advertising",

Nonetheless, with just a little Googling and a bit of help from a friend (for slideshow fades), I was able to put together a 230 slide educational program that pleases me greatly...and I'm a tough audience. It's easy to compose and edit text, insert photos and rearrange the sequence of slides. Yes, I'm a big fan of PowerPoint.",

I don't mind waiting 3 days for one chapter but I find that paying 4€ for 6 chapters is way too much. I started a series but never got to finish it because after chapter 45 you needed to pay. Also once you unlock a chapter with a ticket it closes after 3 days which I find annoying considering I waited 3 days to open it. Love the mangas though.",

Even with less titles there were some great ones and I was just so tired of being nickel and dimed in every other app, and just being able to read everything for a flat fee was super refreshing! I see that's no longer the case and most episodes are only unlockable with gems which can get quite pricey. Very unfortunate to see this happen. I'm too sick of that to revisit this app anymore.",

Instead of diamonds, you could offer membership tiers that unlock stories in full rather than chapter by chapter. this would offer far more affordability and flex",

There's no knowledge review system. Some of the questions can be answered by pure intuition, too. The app seems to have full AI integration, so that's a good thing for its future if it's worked on. The app does have a paywall, but the scholarship option gives you free access if your budget is tight. Please work on it, devs.",

And just recently, needs the permission \"access to make phone calls,\" in order to allow me to keep using the filters & stickers I've paid for over the years. It wouldn't even let me use the app anymore if I don't allow this permission. That said, loved the app over the years. But sadly, it's time to say goodbye. I'm gonna miss Brown on my photos.",

I also have the same issue that others do where read messages aren't marked as such. If I'm going to be forced to use this crappy app, you all need to ensure that it works correctly across all platforms.",
