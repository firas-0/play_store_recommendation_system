The mobile app and the desktop/pc/web versions function a bit differently and you have to get your head around that. Lot's of trial and error. Some pages just don't work on mobile. I recently found out you can't display a basic html table with no attributes on mobile. It just didn't work. If we could get admin functions and a truly responsive experience - so that all pages work on desktop/tablet/mobile - this would be five stars. It's really 3.5 but rounding up because the core functions work properly and the end user experience can be simplified so that they go right where you want them to. A pretty good first effort.

I have lost some weight, and my muscles already feel at least a little stronger. I do it everyday, dont take rest days, dont really feel like i need them. Currently taking beginner course, though i feel it is a little easy, so i might start customizing my workouts or switch to intermediate. Seems to be doing at least something for me though, so thanks. Will report back in a month or two.",

However, the fault comes in when it ramps you up WAY too fast.   There are exercises that just aren't feasible, especially after selecting beginner. On top of that, it's common knowledge that doing an exercise in bad form is even worse for you, so we shouldn't be attempting certain exercises until we're physically able.   I would love to keep using it, but the pacing is so far off it's painful. Needs a little more human curation.",

The 1st movie I ever viewed on Tubi was Sisu (about a gold miner during ww2).. i thought itd be really difficult to top that one...however I have found quite a few films that are equally just as great if not better in their own ways! The only thing I find that irks me is that when I save my liked movies, they disappear when the film is no longer availiable on Tubi. I wish that they could at least find a way to keep the thumbnail saved to the list.",

I used Tubi on my phone all the time, but suddenly I can't hit the backup button because it just gives me a blank screen now and I have to close the app and reopen it. it used to work just fine, don't know if it's the latest update to cause the problem or not. I've uninstall the app and reinstalled it but that didn't help I cannot hit the backup button at all it just gives me a blank screen. if someone can tell me why this is happening I would appreciate it.",

The catalog is wonderful I've noticed so many other movies I want to watch eventually when I can. I've only used the PS5 app though so far so I'm just assuming the phone app will be as easy to use when the time comes. I only wish they would give you an idea when every break is scheduled when you start the movie instead of a small pop-up 5 seconds before each time. I like that it tells how many commercials though",

Rather each advert showing 30 or 40 secs of clips, like 4 times in a row. that's nearly 2 mins of ADS every 10to15mins, just over 15mins of ADS in under 1hour of Film or Animes.",

And when you skip 6 songs on one playlist...you HAVE to go to a different genre or playlist... and the skips carry-over... instead of starting over as if you had just opened up the app... Really sucks to not have more skips from the get-go... when you are really jamming, or you are the DJ for the night... Totally kills the mood when you can't skip over a song that nobody likes and you have ran out of Skips and now you have to pay for it... Then you have to start a whole new playlist, and start all over again and it is a pain in the ass... when you want to hear a certain song and you pull it up, you do not get to hear that song initially... You have to go through so many other songs that you may or may not like to get to the one song that you wanted to hear in the first place... So now I go on YouTube to hear the songs that I want instead of staying on iHeartRadio... Really kind of sucks...",

All sub-tasks will simultaneously mark themselves as completed, and the only way to undo it is to go back and uncheck them one by one. Sometimes the cursor will also skip to the \"Comments\" box while in the middle of writing a sub-task.",

It highlights the whole word when I'm trying to insert a letter and so deletes it which makes editing very difficult in a large quantity of text.

I ordered a fan, the base was twisted and broken by whoever packaged it (they must have realised, so why send it). Why should customers pay postage to return items that aren't fit for purpose? This is the 2nd time needing their terrible customer service. Spent £800+ with them during last 12 months. Might choose to shop elsewhere if I can't trust better service when things go wrong.",

        "content": "I really like this tile game A LOT more than the other tile game (Tile Match) that this developer has! 👍 It has more obstacles to overcome (such as \"frozen\" or \"sticky\" tiles), which makes the game more challenging & more fun - but it's not so difficult that you can't enjoy it. It gets boring when you're doing the same thing over and over again, and you lose interest quickly...at least I do. Great improvement over other tile games!",

The graphics are crisp and clean, after a short time you can change the tile themes and continue to unlock new themes as you progress. The tile sets grow as you increase your skills. You don't have to watch ads but occasionally it's handy to do so rather than use up your coins. All in all a good game, worth having a play.",

The only thing I would change is that the app is sensitive when you scroll through your channels, and it REALLY wants to delete a channel you've picked if you swipe a little too hard. If there was a way to lock them so they don't get deleted so easily, that would be perfect. I also wish the special channels would show what was playing (instead of just like, \"Happy Oldies\"), but its a small thing.",

If this glitch and bugs are fixed then this is a perfect shooting game. There are even many mods to try, new events come up frequently so that players don't get bored. Overall I would recommend this shooting game.Also I know that it is important to update the game, but sometimes they give major updates which require a lot of space.",

And it is surprisingly bad, well \"some\" of the designs in the characters, guns and cars is good but most are bad, so bad. It's also hard to control, unlike other games that you can fix where you want the fire button, reload, and other controls, this game sucks, you can only fix the joystick, the weapons and other minor controls. If and only if they can fix these kind of problems then it will be gud",

It's basically an pay-to-impress/pay-to-play game now, i miss the old time where game play was more important than skins..👍👍",

When you read your comics on a tablet, like I do, it looks very clunky and anything but tiny and makes reading them quite unpleasant. Because of this, I have almost stopped reading some of my favorite comics that moved to Tinyview. (29/8/2021) Edited (10/5/2023) to add this has not improved at all. The awfulness of the app is the only reason I'm not subscribing.",

You can add any city in why country around the world and it shows you weather of that place too (in case you have family or friends living else where and want to add those places ). Doesn't bombard you with ads(only 1 pops up in the start i think which you have a choice to close). Thank you",

Another problem that needs resolving is not showing the actual street you're supposed to turn on, but just showing distance from the turn and an arrow pointing to the right of left. This sometimes forces users with hearing lost to spend more time staring at the map to avoid missing a turn than watching the road.",

I love this app a lot! gives us access to many sort of \"cameras\" and filters. gives you that nostalgic, retro effects & you can even mess around with your own editing. the only problem i have is that sometimes if you're using the app after, maybe, 3-5 minutes of use, it'll start slowing down and lagging. so hopefully they fix this issue and make it smooth.",
