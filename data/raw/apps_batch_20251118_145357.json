They have it to where it opens up in a separate window and you can't even zoom in without it disappearing back down then it closes out. I have to go back and open it again and again because all it does is close. The men modeling have no pictures or videos of the back of the clothes or underwear. It would be nice to see what something looks like on the back. I hope all of this gets fixed.",

So, if you can't pay it off right away it's certainly NOT WORTH GETTING not even for the perks.

I have another card which will instantly transfer from my bank account, so I know it can be done. There isn't a quick way to see your balance without doing a full login (another thing I know is doable). But my biggest gripe with this service is this app is TERRIBLE. Full of ads for all their different \"benefits,\" re investing and stocks, none of which I really need. The menu for transferring money is hard to find. It logs out for no apparent reason (even though I just spent several minutes trying to find the transfer money menu, it told me it was logging me out for inactivity, and logged off in spite of me repeatedly pressing the \"continue\" button). I know this sounds like I'm an old fart who doesn't know how to use apps, but I'm fairly technically capable. This app is just not very intuitive. I like the concept of having a chip card and the interest, but I'm not certain at this point I will keep this account.",

They do not offer email support, even though error messages in the app say to email support. You have to find time during their business hours to chat or call them. The chat starts with an automated agent. When I finally got to a human they didn't tell me that they couldn't see what I had already typed in. I thought they were looking into the problem, when apparently they were just wasting time. I entered my email address during the chat to receive a transcript of it. The email I received says it contains a transcript, but it does not. They are only able to handle one debit card per account. When you request a new one they automatically cancel your old one. They are unable to activate debit cards once they are cancelled, you just have to hope that your new one arrives. Mine did not. If USPS returned it to SoFi, they did not notify me. The debit card activation system via phone does not work, it just tells you to use the app. Setting the PIN while activating a debit card via the app does not work.

My only complaint is an ongoing lack of receiving my heart/s (jewels) as rewards. When I buy them, I get them, but still cannot receive them otherwise. I reluctantly uninstalled, cleaned up the cache, waited a little while, then re-installed. I was ecstatic I didnt have to start all over, but sad the same problem persists.",

Chats can be very big and scrolling up and down is not convenient. thank you for attention!🤝",

It doesn't provide me very normal information such as a tourist itinerary, but why? It says it is beyond its scope. 2. Slow response or generation speed. It is a bit slow in generating the full response. \"Beyond my scope\" error for even basic information is very bad. I am not asking for anything sensitive or political at all. Overall, the app can be better and make newer models.",

Most important part for me is the widget that lets me monitor a list of symbols on my home screen without having to fire up the app. (Though occasionally the widget doesn't seem to want to refresh without a nudge.) The level of advertising is perfectly acceptable to keep the product free, though as some others have noted, there seem to be more scammy/junk ads appearing these days. That probably has more to do with their ad network provider than with the app. The articles are sometimes interesting and useful--just avoid the comment streams, which are populated by nothing but trolls and zealots both left and right--nothing useful there. Would be great if the company offered a lower-price paid version that removed ads and didn't offer as many of the advanced features. For my purposes, $60/year is too steep, but I'd definitely pay $20.",

Just have an ad at the bottom or top of the app like everyone else does. The main drawback is you can only add 1 widget with max 8 symbols. If you add a second widget they both display the same watchlist. If you change the watchlist in one, it changes in the other too. Would also be nice if they had a 1x1 or 1x2 widget to allow a single stock to be shown on your home screen without taking up too much space. Widget is a bit slow to refresh but not too bad. I think with some improvements to the widget functionality this could be my one and only app, but right now I have to use 2 to be able to have 2 watchlists.",

It doesn't have a dark mode and the selection of interests at the start is limited (why is \"technology\" lumped in with \"wellness\"?). For whatever reason it doesn't let you enter a name (not a username) longer than 15 characters. So if you have a long name / last name, you'll have to deal with that. It can also be a bit buggy at times especially when switching between search categories.",

The layout is really nice and sleek, I don't feel overwhelmed looking at everything. A massive plus is the lack of ads. A lot of websites and social media nowadays bombard you with ads and it's awful, MAJOR kudos for the lack of ads 👍🏼👍🏼",

If you could upload longer footage, then I believe it could do much better. Also, I really don't like that you have to find videos on the homepage before you can scroll videos. The app is just not set up for casual scrolling, and It feels like you can't post much beyond pictures or 60-second clips. Also, it would help if the algorithm would push out smaller users/new videos to more people.",

Posts and profile pictures stay as gray loading screens. Secondly, I'd prefer a dark mode. Bright things are very hard for me to see, and the color contrasts and hinders my focus. Last, it would be nice to be able to choose who can see your posts. I don't know if there's a friend system in place, but some posts are better kept in tight circles.",

This makes the map and upcoming directions so much harder to read. How about giving us a choice of color schemes? Another suggestion is to remember the navigation display choices such as split screen view. I have to re-select this every time I start navigation.",

If that's what you're looking for, this is NOT THE APP!

For some perspective, I have been a CoPilot fan since the early 2000's when I would use it for work travel and would run it on my laptop, connected to a power inverter, connected to the cigarette lighter plug with the GIANT yellow USB plugged GPS receiver that sat on the dash. If you're wondering why I don't use Google Maps that comes on all Android based head units, it's about the same. You can download maps but, it's less than user friendly if you don't have a data connection. I use in car navigation a lot. When you travel for work, it's so much nicer to have a big screen than a phone screen. When I saw CoPilot in the app store, I was excited to see something I knew and trusted from the past. This isn't the same. If it is more user friendly, then I haven't figured it out. If you want a self-sufficient all in one navigation app like you would get in a vehicle with OEM navigation from the factory, this IS NOT IT. The biggest regret... I purchased it before giving it a longer try than just a couple trips in town. If I could get a refund, I would ask for one.",

Yeah...no longer worth the money! Update: Trimble did ask me to create a ticket. Support asked to try signing out of the account, deleting the app and an associated folder, then reinstalling and signing in again. It didn't work. So they issued me a 30 Active Traffic subscription. Once they did that, I was able to get the paid subscription again and it's working. So, I made it a 4 again. Another reviewer reminded me of something that stands out well beyond other maps. While CoPilot does use wifi/data, it is not needed at all! With the downloaded maps, you can still navigate without the use of any data or wifi. I don't know any other apps that can boast that capability.",

So the reliability of the GPS I have is very important for me. And this is where I have problem with this app. On number of occasions this app went crazy and failed. Luckily it always was right after installing updates. I'm very much afraid to have GPS failure somewhere in a wilderness without any way to fix it that's why I seriously consider now (after yet another failure here at home that followed an update) to drop it and find something more reliable. So far I submitted my ticket and will see how it'll be resolved. From my experience support is not so great on this app and sometimes they are not in a big rush on those tickets.",

It is a very well thought out truck GPS that functions well. THE ONLY REASON I cannot give it a 5-star review is due to that you cannot view alternate routes, you have to wait for it to recalculate en route. It is totally understandable that the map updates cannot keep up with changing construction, being able to view different route options would make this app almost perfect.",

On the app, if you look at the course list, there's no indicator on which you completed. Example, I'm going to do all math, from early/kid to high school.

I understand that's Google TTS but given that's the best option for this app, it stinks. Third, this makes my phone blazing hot. Finally, it doesn't work on Android Auto without yet another add on and a rooted device.

I also wish it could work off of routes developed on Basecamp or something. That said, it has all the features you could want, and is my main nav for more complex trips. For simple nav, I just use Google Maps and download the maps.",

When I re-opened it, I was still on the same game but my coins were still gone. It doesn't seem fair. Why is the game freezing when it never did that before?",

I rarely play anymore because it's just frustrating, no fun or relaxation anymore. Only gave 2 stars because of the graphics and variety of games within the game.

They really had something special with this game, but they are turning into just another trashy, developed overnight, cash grab. It's just sad.",

And I used to enjoy completing puzzles. But the increasing levels of difficulty have zero appeal.

You can play and advance fast without spending ANYTHING. it's very well made, incredibly easy and the sheer lack of bombardment by wanting your money is fantastic. It's awesome because the more they don't focus on my wallet, the more I don't mind spending some cash for extra stuff in the game. Thumbs up 👍",

Video ads were optional - sometimes at the end of the game you could watch some videos to get extra tries to complete a level. This made it tolerable to get past tougher levels. However, they recently implemented a persistent banner ad and it appears the extra video ads to get more tries is no longer an option. I uninstalled it due to these changes. Not worth it anymore.",

It should allow me to choose whether to start over again. I don’t want to start over, so I uninstalled the game.",

I still play almost every day, but the span of time I can play without rage quitting decreases daily",
