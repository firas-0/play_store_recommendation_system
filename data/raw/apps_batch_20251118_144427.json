What the offer did NOT tell me, was that I had to claim the $40 in daily segments 😡 lost almost all of it because of the company's fine print.

Things disappear and reappear at times, especially when I get enough items to merge which can be very frustrating.

        "content": "New Review: This is a great app. Not only one of the most accurate background removal tools I have used, but certainly the fastest. It's become a necessity for my eBay business. The annual cost for Pro is worth the price. To make this a 5 star review, there is one glitch that needs to be fixed and one element that needs to be changed. The glitch is that every other time I try to do a multiple photo background remove, after the first image is scanned, it reverts to the previous batch of photos that I selected. I need to go back, re-select the images, and start again. Nothing dire, but an annoyance. Even more helpful than fixing that glitch would be to change the way the edited photos are named when saved. My phone's photos are named with a timestamp. The Photoroom saved photos append \"Photoroom\" to the FRONT of the name which means when I download and sort all my pictures, the Photoroom pictures are separated from their originals because it's sorted alphabetically by name. If \"Photoroom\" was added to the END of the original file name, I would be able to see the original and the edited pictures side by side. I photograph products for eBay and have hundreds of pictures at a time. When I go to organize and upload my photos, it would be great if all the pictures of the product (both original and edited) were all side by side and grouped together. Instead, I have one grouping of the originals and then way down at the bottom are the edited pictures. It makes organizing more difficult. If \"Photoroom\" was simply appended to the END of the original name, they would all be grouped together naturally. I hope that makes sense. Former Review: I need some tech support. I'm a paid subscriber using a Samsung Galaxy S10E. The app has been glitching the past couple of days, but suddenly today it is completely non functional. Every time I select a picture, it starts the \"scan\" and then says \"an error occurred\". I have removed and reinstalled it and I have restarted my phone. Nothing works.",

In order to know how much you'll spend with a non-Dash-Pass account, you have to waste time making the order and clicking continue to see how much you'll actually spend.

Recently started to get into collecting comics (Mostly Jack of Hearts related) and it's been difficult to find a service which has most of the more obscure stuff already catalogued somewhere. This app is super easy to use out of the box and is a great companion to the main website. To get the most out it you need to subscribe to the monthly service but it's literally such a small fee you can get all 3 options (Mobile, Windows, and Web) for around $8/Mth. Worth every penny.",

Even when I followed the size chart I still had sizing issues. Their prices are very cheap, so you risk not being able to wear the clothing yourself. Trade off price/size",

How about, if you're going to try to manage your app and enforce rules, actually have real people look into the enforcing process, rather than just punishing people with zero thought behind it. 👎",

    "description": "It's never too early to start your child's education. Preschoolers, kindergarteners, toddlers, and older kids are eager to learn their ABCs, counting, addition, subtraction, and more! The best way to encourage that is to share smart, well-made educational apps and games with them on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nMath Kids is a free learning game designed to teach young children numbers and mathematics. It features several mini-games that toddlers and pre-K kids will love to play, and the more they do the better their math skills will become! Math Kids will help preschoolers, kindergarteners, 1st graders to learn to identify numbers and start training with addition and subtraction puzzles. They'll have a great time completing games and earning stickers, and you‘ll have a great time watching them grow and learn.\r\n\r\nMath Kids features a number of puzzles that teach while your child plays, including:\r\n• Counting - Learn to count objects in this simple game of addition.\r\n• Compare - Children can build their counting and comparing skills to see which group of items is bigger or smaller.\r\n• Adding Puzzle - A fun mini-game where kids create math problems by dragging numbers on the screen.\r\n• Adding Fun - Count the objects and tap on the missing number.\r\n• Adding Quiz - Put your child's math and addition skills to the test.\r\n• Subtracting Puzzle - Fill in the missing symbols in the math problem.\r\n• Subtracting Fun - Count the items to solve the puzzle!\r\n• Subtracting Quiz - See how much your child has improved in their mathematics skills for subtraction.\r\n\r\nWhen kids can play while they're learning, they're much more likely to recall information. It also makes them want to learn more frequently, which will give them a huge boost when they start kindergarten.\r\n\r\nMath Kids also comes with a number of features that help adults monitor and manage their child's progress. Customize game modes to increase or decrease the difficulty, or check report cards to see scores for previous rounds.\r\n\r\nMath Kids is the perfect introduction to the basics of counting, addition, and subtraction. It will teach your toddler, kindergartener, 1st grader sorting, and logical skills along with early mathematics, giving them the perfect foundation for a lifetime of learning.\r\n\r\nNote to Parents:\r\nWhen creating Math Kids, we focused on building the best possible learning experience for children of all ages. We're parents ourselves, so we know exactly what makes a good educational game, as well as what doesn't. We released Kids Math as a completely free game with no in-app purchases or third party ads. Math Kids is full featured, frustration free, and ready to go. It’s exactly the kind of educational app we want for our children, and we think your family will enjoy it, too!\r\n\r\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios",

One thing that would be a really nice addition, if ever possible, is doing groups of math problems as a selection like numbers 1-10 in a group, 11-20, 21-30 etc so if a child struggles with one group, you could single it out to practice just those. But we LOVE this app. No ads, no push to buy things, and tons of learning! Truly thankful for this app.",

The app, though, could use some updates: quizzes and exercises are hard to visualize and, therefore, to complete; there should be an option that allows you to mark the courses that interest you without having to start them immediatly: there are so many of them and I'd rather not have to screenshot every single one that I find interesting.",

My main issue is when reading articles in the built-in browser, there's no way to properly go back if I click a link in the article. The links work and will go to the right page, but using the back button/gesture exits the article back to the story summary, making me have to find the article again and reload it (the browser is a bit slow at loading). A little tedious in those cases. But overall good app and insightful service!",

The idea of aggregating stories on the same subject from different sources and then ranking them based on lean intrigued me and I downloaded the app. It'll work about 75% of the time. The entire app won't load sometimes, sometimes stories won't load. It's patchy at best. Hopefully they'll iron things out but as of now they won't be getting my money. But maybe one day 🤞",

Also, the comics seem to be AI-generated, though it isn't 100% obvious if you're not looking for it. I noticed blatant errors like the MC's earrings growing 10x between consecutive frames and a guy with 6 fingers on one hand, though. Clearly they keep up their \"new chapter drops everyday\" by churning out pages with AI.",

Also, when you do select the meal you want it to go to, then select favorites, it forgets which meal you picked & places it in a random meal. Difficult to search by name for an item not favorited.

At this point I'm only using it to make sure I drink water and eat enough calories per meal, which I could do on my own.

        "content": "Very bad experience!. Price freeze is just ridiculous. I paid 40 to be able to get a 400 usd ticket. When I decided to purchase the actual ticket, within the price freeze time period, they said it was not available anymore and I'd have to pay a difference!! I ended up paying 500 usd for the ticket. And I could see the ticket for less in the airline webpage!! To make things worst the airline cancelled part of the trip later on. The problem is that you can only communicate with Hopper via email and answering is not their strength. After 3 full days they haven't answered to an email I sent. Sure sent it on a Fri but wouldn't you expect them working on the weekends?. If you need a ticket soon what can you do??? If you try to do the few alternatives they offer in the application there's only warnings (you can be charged for this, this or that.....) so it is scary to select anything. I had to call twice the airline to fix the issue. First time the agent told me to talk to the travel agency (yeah! good luck with that!!). Luckily the second time I tried I got to an agent that reissued the ticket on a similar route without paying one additional dollar. This app maybe convenient to search for a ticket, but I will never use it again to buy one. The stress you have to go through if there's an issue is not worth the money and/or time. I should have read the other reviews before trying. Hope this helps you decide.",

After downloading the app's most recent update I have noticed that I'm not able to directly search for things specifically in the app right after I see ads for them. Interesting!

With the lack of editing this app has, I can't invest in the amount of money they are asking for VIP. I'm an avid reader who gets immersed in a story, and it's hard to move to another book. Now I feel stuck.",

There is no way I would pay for such a rip-off app. People have lives, have to work, kids, etc. Not worth reading and fighting through twenty ads to read 15 minutes then wait 30 minutes, or 6 hours? WTH? That said, if you find completed stories, some of the writers are really pretty good. Hopefully they're being compensated for their work.",

There's certain of those \"ads\" that I'll fully close the app and force stop it rather than \"watching\" and having it try to force me to a site to get off the page. Author quality... mid. You'd 100% of the time find better quality on fanfic sites, but it's acceptable for non-fanfic I guess",
