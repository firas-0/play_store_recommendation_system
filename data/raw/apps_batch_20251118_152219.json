I can't mess around with the +/- buttons while I'm driving. 2) the app needs serious route/re-routing work, look devs, doing a u-turn should not be an option for a semi truck. Big trucks can't just turn around on any street. Devs please email me for more suggestions",

Sometimes it doesn't refresh quick enough and I miss an exit, but, over all, very well done.",

Cannot select multiple route options every time (but sometimes it will let you).

I have much more important things to do in life than play this game hours on end everyday. Was fun while it lasted.",

And adding a new gun doesn't make the game cool. Add attachment, remake the maps like it's newest PC version, add realistic driving features. 🫡",

One small suggestion though: it would be great if there was an option to make your profile private, so others can’t view it if you don’t want them to. Also, a feature to fully block someone so your name doesn’t even appear in their searches would make the experience even better. Keep up the great work!",

I would definitely do another e-bike tour, only one negative is that it was maybe a tiny bit pricey, but overall it was excellent.",

We even stopped for some lunch. I would 100% recommend this trip. Definitely worth the money. Bargain",

Connects for remote control of your camera for tripod use. You can change (depending on camera mode) ISO, White Balance, Shutter Speed, Aperature, lighting type, then take pictures remotely, without touching your camera  Cons: Isn't terribly intuitive to connect to the camera from your phone. There should be a tutorial for each camera type on how you do that.  The interface isn't terribly intuitive once you get it open, either. Changing multiple settings can mean backing out of \"remote shooting\" mode and going back in to get to other settings.  Because it keeps your sensor open and continues to send images to the phone while you're using it as a remote, it burns through the camera's battery *very* quickly.  I'm somewhere between a 3 and a 4 on the app, but when I need it, I'm glad that it's there.

That's a huge drawback, since the camera is marketed to content creators. Second, I'm not able to use the side buttons on my phone to release the shutter. That means when I'm taking self portraits I have to find a way to keep the phone out of the shot, but still in a position where I can see where I'm touching on the phone screen. If the app had voice activation or used the volume buttons to release the shutter it would eliminate this obstacle.",

But, when you are watching the ads for the free moves, especially if it is a Shein ad, if you click the \"X\" too soon, it takes you to the actual Shein app, then you lose any free moves you were trying to get. I was playing level 42 in the Arena just now. I needed one move to complete it. I clicked to watch the ad. Of course, it was a Shein ad. So, needless to say, I am still stuck on level 42 🤦",

The developers do a good job of providing bonuses that players can win by playing or just even opening the app. However, there are just too many levels where you can't pass with using extra moves. Extra moves cost gold coins. While gold coins can be won with free play, they cost real money. So, I think that the developers prevent players from passing levels in order to get them to purchase gold coins and other add ons to aid game play.",

OK. you used to offer ads for extra moves, but took that away.some levels you will be stuck on until the championship week is over with. which means you will lose tons of side quest prizes.

It's the only alphabet/phonics app I've found that keeps her engaged for a while. She loves the stories and the speaking tasks. Wish there was a British English option though.",

Like, whenever it teaches you a letter, the sound gets quieter in the middle of the sound, which isn't a major mistake, but it is a bit annoying, for me, at least. I'm a 13 year old trying this out btw, so idk how younger kids would like the app.",

The writing portion (drawing alphabet characters) is jumpy and not very precise. My child simply scribbled an answer that was accepted before she even completed the character. 2. The letters have a picture of an animal or object associated with that letter. Educators should not group letters with pictures for young readers. TO BE CONT",

Also, why can we no longer go straight to a specific verse but now have to stroll all the way down? It makes it hard to cross reference while studying. Highlights have changed, and I had been color coding. Sigh.",

Some of the translations have an Audiobook with it, which I think the audio could be improved, I don't like that if I pause the audio in the middle of a chapter it starts the whole chapter over when I press play unless I'm hitting play within a minute of pausing. It makes it difficult to get through big chapters like Psalm 119.",

I've seen it work its magic on old, blurry photos, and the results are nothing short of amazing ¹. One of the standout features of Remini is its ability to enhance faces in photos. It can take a blurry, low-resolution image and turn it into a sharp, detailed portrait.",

Flipping back and forth from this app and play store to actually exit. This app was the greatest. Now is very very bad.",

Sometimes the arms or legs are too long for the body size. The hair feature mixes up the styles/textures or a portion of the hair hangs off. It would be nice to incorporate a few different heights and physical body types. The ai facial features are spot on at times. I would give it a higher star rating if it would fix the disfigured creature features.",

One thing i will say is, adding more modes to offline mode will definitely reel more players to download, since there are times internet access is unavailable to others. this game is one i would recommend",

When I try to contact customer support, they don’t listen, avoid questions, and even disconnect the chat or call. Completely unacceptable and disappointing service.",

I'm level 386). My only criticism is that I wish the room decorating part was more interactive. Like giving choices of different decor to use.",

When you fail to complete a level, it gives you the option to continue playing with a certain amount of moves, but the price is stupid. For 5 more moves, it's literally 900 coins. That may not be a problem for veteran players who have been playing the game long enough to be loaded, but for newer players, it drains your bank. It's very frustrating when you can literally win in a move. Please fix it. Also, a match 3 game, not a save the king game.",

If you offered a decent price, I'd subscribe all year, every year instead of just Q2-Q4, every 4 years. As is, considering overwhelming product adoption, I'd say you're already getting paid an extraordinary salary.",

Earlier, the share option and indicator option were right in the main hub, but now they’re hidden under the three-dot menu. Instead, the brokers tab takes up that space, which feels unnecessary and frustrating. I don’t want the brokers tab on the hub—what I really need is quick access to sharing and indicators. Please bring those options back to the main Analysis Hub or at least give us options to hide the broker tab",

I have not been able to play in over a month! The game litterally freezes within 2 seconds of loading. You CAN'T play! There was ONE day in the last 30 that it played no problem and then that night it froze again and has ever since. I've seen so many complaints about it and hope they fix it soon otherwise they will lose countless players forever.",

However, it's got a lot of limitations that I wish I could see improvement on-- specifically, scheduling. Many events last only an hour, and all events are exclusively during the day. This may not be an issue for most people, but sadly I work the graveyard shift and sleep during the day, so if I want to participate in raids, community days, or highlight hours, I have to forgo sleep.",

Now it takes a week and a half to save up for three, and buying three doesn't save you coins unless there's a fake discount meant to make you think you're getting a deal even though you aren't because you are still massively over paying. It's ridiculous. The average casual player, which is the vast majority of the player base, agrees because this makes it harder to play.",

I have to go through periods of inactivity because of a limited storage space for Pokemon. Shame. It could be good.",

Some evolutionary items are hard to get like the Sun Stone and the Dragon Scale, and when you do get those items it's mostly involved with a task of evolving a certain pokemon. The problem is that there are so many pokemon that you have to use one of those in order to evolve, but you can't because the drop rate for the Sun Stone and the Dragon Scale is horrible. Personally, I wish evolutionary items could be available to be purchased.",

Almost 6 years later, some of these issues have been resolved and some additional things have been added (remote raid, better friends' interactions, routes).",

By adding the pokeballs to routes as a random spawn like the zygard cells you can make routes more rewarding, with drops like zygard cells in a range of 1-5, berries, stardust, XP and more. This game has so much potential, don't waste it.",

Graphs, charts and tables are many times useless. There is no zoom capabalites so unless you have bionic eyes you're not getting to understand the data. 3. Offline reading still NOT possible.

Just unacceptable to have major IT problems when paying a significant amount for a subscription (more than other subscriptions), and for a product devoted largely to business and technology journalism.",

There is no way to cancel the subscription through the app and the only way to do it is by calling customer service so if you're busy you'll often put it off.",
