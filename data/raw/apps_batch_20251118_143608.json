It's overall buggy, there are multiple intrusive ads, and perhaps the worst part is when I'm doing checkpoints and tests, they don't show me the entire question. I am learning about floristry and during the testing they only show me part of the sentence instead of the full question. It's extremely frustrating.",

My only problem is in Latin Spanish, progress is stuck on 1% fluent and no words are being added to vocabulary review, whereas I'm not having that problem w/ Italian.",

If you're an absolute beginner, you probably would be fine picking this app up; it certainly has some fun gimmick in being able to engage with native speakers to an extent. However, if you're at an intermediate level, you'll notice immediately what is lacking here: kanji. This is a critical component for anyone wanting to go beyond elementary reading, and even makes it harder to absorb vocabulary as kanji is in itself a big giveaway for the meaning of a word. I couldn't find any setting to turn kanji on or off (although you can switch between kana and romaji). Other things I find lacking: - advertised a placement test but I did not see any such option when I started the Japanese course - requiring payment info to do the premium trial (always a scummy move when a company tries to automatically begin payment after the trial period) - I find the pictures can be big giveaways for vocabulary meaning during the tests, which makes it artificially easier when doing recognition testing - pictures should only be prompts for recall/production. - Speakers at times do not speak clearly and mumble or speak deadpan, which makes it hard to clearly understand sentences Some of these flaws likely carry to other languages - others may be unique to the Japanese unit only. I can't offer a rating as far as the other lanuages go, just my experience with this one. Trying to find intermediate learning options for Japanese is difficult, but I think I will pass on this one, at least in so far as paying for anything.",

(Re: developer response: there's nothing more to tell. If I was taught the word in hiragana, that doesn't help me guess the kanji.)",

With bonus workouts to download. The workouts aren't very long either, and u can go at ur own speed. I'm looking forward to trying the higher levels.",

Everything is really easy to follow. The app notifies me when its time to workout and it wont let you cheat or fake the workout. Once the app isn't active the timer stops, and the workout isn't completed until the last set is done (including your stretches)",

However, there has been a bug recently where upon trialing the \"peak\" option, as soon as I disconnected from internet it signed me out of my account. This happened twice, both times when backpacking without internet access, essentially making the app useless aside from the map for viewing (available in free mode), as I could not view my downloaded trails/routes. As such not sure about the app's utility for backpacking.",

I'd like to be able to make a playlist of multiple sleep meditations for those nights when sleep is very elusive. The sleep radio isn't much better, since there's only 3 options and they're 95% white noise.",

In general, the app went from being a daily source of joy and calm into a daily source of frustration. I won't be renewing my subscription.",

Ebb is fun but it gets my requests wrong. I remember the original Headspace was very simple and cute which made me want to meditate. this new app is overwhelming. Every time I use it, I get turned off. Also - use a compressor on the voices so there's less dynamic range. the uneven volume makes for a poor listening experience. I will not be renewing.",

The only thing I wish they did was add a yearly subscription, kinda like how Spotify does it. They could even do this outside the app on their own website to make sure they get all the money and can offer the best discount for that yearly subscription. Overall, it's way better than Spotify, but it definitely needs more artists because some really popular ones are missing.",

It's not glitchy, doesn't have lots of ads, cool features, but the only downside is that the songs don't have lyrics, but on the other half it's an amazing application",

Next, some songs were unavailable there (e.g.; You're looking for 'JoyRide' by CORTIS and it doesn't show up). What's worse is that my fav song isn't there ㅠㅠ.

After testing other apps, it has good accuracy as well. Not a fan of there being no way to opt out of giving your data to advertisers, though data collection is limited to IMEI and hardware identifiers. The widgets have little options or diversity, but makes up for it with having really dang good widgets. Overall I give this app an A-!",

Please note that theri tracking system is real, not like Lazada which I think is not true, considering that even if the item had already been picked up by the local carrier as indicated, it would still take another 2 weeks for them to deliver, You'll be wondering as to who is informing you correctly.

They can't even get to resolve more than 2 weeks delayed order no matter how many times you have reached them, even their chat is so annoying you barely get a human! Their delivery vouchers are unreliable and too low to avail it compared again the same. I am uninstalling this app after if I get the order to finalize either cancel-refund or delivered so very late.

The most they offer is a $5 credit which never covers the cost of the item. I'm waiting now for them to credit back the rest of an order, which they may just never do and then I'm out $15.

You can still play offline or open a private room and play online with friends. I would suggest better match making, so people may avoid playing with a bot that eventually ends getting exploited by one of the players.",

Once they buy the Place, you trade them with exactly 60% of marked price on board (120 rs for a station of 200 rs) they will sell it to you, unless they haven't purchased atleast 2 out of 3 places of same color.

Let the CPU buy it and buy it back for cheaper. Get 1 property of each color to block building. Trains are a great source of income if you have 3 or 4. If other players are low on cash you can get property for very cheap in the bidding process. Happy gaming.",

The changes are horrible. *** update as of 5/22. It got better for a short time, but now it sucks again. Ads ads ads ads ads blah blah blah. This is ridiculous. Get your algorithm straight.",
