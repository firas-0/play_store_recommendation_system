You can prove they're lying via messages, and then they can lower your rating without even receiving a product. Why are buyers allowed to rate a product when it's been canceled for legitimate reasons. They will not back you as a seller. It's great if you're a buyer, but it's terrible if you're a seller. You have no protection, just the illusion of it. Be warned. I'm going to move over to PayPal and Mercari.",

This all seems outrageous when it costs them the same to list a book as it does to list an appliance. Other platforms with payments are cheaper, around 12% of item In this way eBay is inflating prices of used goods....",

Every time gives me superior options to the alternatives. Gives more information on Bus route changes and closures. And the bike routes? Incredible!! I've stopped using Google Maps altogether because of how it prioritizes bike paths to the point of inconvenience. If you want actually good non-car route assistance, try Citymapper!

When you offer so many thousands of options, that's awfully unwieldy. (Yeah, I know I can search, but that's clunky at best, and NO, I don't have or want Alexa).",

When I tried to add it it was impossible to find out how to add a device. Besides the fact that there were old iPads and computers there that shouldn’t have been. As usual navigation of this app is confusing. I will now purchase directly from the HBO max app. There I click on the app and I can play it with no issues. This is why I don’t like to purchase an app within the google play app. I can’t find it when I want it or can’t load it on my device. You have much work to do when it comes to User friendly or how easy it is to navigate your apps.",

Lessons are very short, and launch immediately one after another, until you run out of free lessons (5 a day) or until you click the X botton on the bottom left and confirm that you wish to exit the lesson. The cat avatar that is assigned to you doesn't seem to be customizable, sadly. I wish they will add this feature.",

Ibwould recommend giving it a try, you don't entirely need pro as it does give you 5 free lessons a day, but if you really want to learn the language and have as much fun doing so, it wouldn't hurt to subscribe to it",

What makes it more frustrating is that we pay for premium! If it were all free, I wouldn't even have a right to complain. But we pay about $25 per month! The least YT can do is make their app work. They keep updating it and changing things that don't need to be changed, which then causes me problems to arise. PLEASE FIX YT!!!!",

I enjoy reading but whenever I wanted to get busy, I'd just switch to listening until I could go back to reading. I switched to premium because I wanted to be able to do other things with my phone while listening and though they're AI voices doing the reading, they're frankly doing a better job than many narrators out there, lol. So, yes, I recommend and am happy with my premium purchase too.",

The collections option is also great for when I have the odd receipt pdf so i can sort thise out of regular reading. :)",

My ultimate goal was to sync my steps from my 'Garmin Forerunner 645 Music' to Google Fit (in order to track my runs for Pokemon Go, without carrying my phone with me). On my initial install, I tried it out with the trial and things worked like they should. The app does a great job of walking you through the setup process (which varies depending on the apps you're syncing.) After my trial was up, I encountered an issue when attempting to purchase the lifetime license of the app, so I reached out to support. Hielko walked me through troubleshooting steps until the issue was resolved and it's now working great. I'd definitely recommend this app to anyone aiming to reliably sync or export health data from sources that otherwise won't allow them to do so.",

It worked great on my Samsung Galaxy S8, but since upgrading to the S10, I've had difficulty getting the app to recognize that Garmin Connect is syncing, which means that Health Sync is not capturing the data to push to Google Fit. I have tried disabling all of the battery saving \"features\" that Samsung utilizes, but still can't seem to get the app to sync the data with any regularity. Just for reference, on my S8, it would sync multiple times throughout the day and everytime I hit the manual sync button in Garmin Connect, but on the S10 it seems the best I can do is about one sync per day, and even that is hit or miss. There is no option to force a manual sync in the Health Sync app if you're using Garmin as the source data, so the fact that it doesn't detect when Garmin is syncing makes the app ineffective. EDIT: Apparently the issue was related to the SmartSwitch when I transferred the apps from my S8 to S10. I was able to resolve the issue by completely uninstalling both apps and starting over from scratch. It's now working as expected. Just FYI - in this case, it had nothing to do with the battery saving settings. Back to 5 stars!",

It's so clean, much better than if the ad was superimposed on the artwork. When you added the feature to change album artwork I was elated. I hate to have that space blank. You also made it easier to minimize the now playing screen. There isn't much more to ask for besides crossfade; the lyrics are never correct and the share and lyrics button are ugly.",

Many other music apps offer that. Also, when playing music, eventually the screen will go dark.

The only criticism is, unless I'm missing something, there is no way to set track numbers to songs in albums. The only way to get an album to play in order of how it was released on CD if importing files from a CD is to create a Playlist and rearrange the order in the Playlist. It would be nice if each song appeared in order in the album.",

It could be better if 1. they had a link to allow you to buy the physical book (ironic given its partnership with AMZ) because some books really need to be read too. Many come with downloadable pdfs which is a HUGE help but it's only going to be key graphics/content the author decides to include with the audiobook. 2. the bookmarks need to recede the mark by at least 30 seconds, especially in car mode-before u realize the value.",

I'm not winning any coins or power ups..if I want a power up during the level you have to watch at least 4 or 5 ads and only get one at a time...say it's the scramble the tiles..you watch this long ad..only get one and of course I have to use it and then I want say an undo time..another long ad and you get only 1 tile...very frustrating and annoying..the description of the game says there are purchases but I have seen none.
