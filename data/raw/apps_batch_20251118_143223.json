The pre-scheduling feature isn't as good either. I'm just not a fan of it.",

Plus there's no feature to say what time of day a symptom begins or stops. seems important to look for correlations with environmental or meals",

Here's my point: A bunch of the characters are way too overpowered, items in the shop are sooooo overpriced (for a mobile game!), and once you get to a high enough level, your game will put you on a team that sucks and put you against players that are using way too powerful characters... Don't recommend playing this game... it's a waste of your time, money, and life. If you are going to play it, play private games with your friends! It's pretty fun.",

Also gems one of the most valuable currencies has like no value. sometimes you also have way more power pts than coins or the other way around. Still i recommend",

But ever since they removed the boxes and kept changing things nonstop, constantly adding new brawlers, abilities, collaborations, and rarities, the game has just gotten worse over time. It's not fun anymore, and after more than six years, I finally decided to delete it - and I don't plan on reinstalling it anytime soon.",

Apart from having THE WORST MATCHMAKING OF ANY MOBILE GAME EVER (especially considering I've played many of them and this one is by far the worst), just gets more frustrating playing against brand new broken characters they refuse to balance and just the overall lack of a skill system. This game used to be fun back then now it's just begging for a comeback. Glad this game is slowly dying.",

One issue I have with the recent update, though, is that once you click on a booster for a level, the option to keep using it stays selected for the following levels, unless you unselect it. I try to save them for the very hard levels, but didn't know that the update kept them selected. Suddenly, a bunch of boosters I'd been saving for when I needed them were gone, and that was really frustrating",

Suggestions for improvement: 1) 4 day challenge events - change the item to collect to match the character theme. it's repetitive and boring that it's always a key. 2) Add some building or decorating events. Take a scent from a movie, remove everything but the background and collect items to restore the scene. 3) or decorate, create houses for each character and collect items to select various decor that is character themed to decorate their make believe house",

        "content": "Good game but interrupts with too many ads. Edit: I guess it's annoying that the ads interrupt the flow. Other methods/games have a set number of free games/credits per period and the ads are voluntarily started if additional rounds are desired. After each game is a bit much. Yes, I understand that ad free is available for a nominal fee... but i don't know if the puzzles become intriguing later because i hit a pay/ad wall quickly. So, again, the games I did play are good, the app works as advertised (hence the 3 stars), but the fast ad wall uninspired me (which is why I no longer play it and uninstalled). Other games, i freely click on starting ads of my own volition because they engage me enough to where I want to continue. This particular implementation is cumbersome with involuntary/mandatory ads. If the game added challenges or personal goals, that would probably add a star, two if it becomes addictive. But alas, i'm not inspired to purchase, hence stuck at 3 stars for me. My suggestion: First 20 games or so free (get me addicted), then 3-5 games free per day with ads for more. Perhaps more challenging puzzles cost more free plays. 1 credit for easy games, 2 for medium, 3 for hard, etc. The pixel art is not inspiring (at least the first few ones I did play). Now if you took several puzzles and they interlocked to create a larger picture, that would be a reasonably interesting challenge and could inspire. That could cause people to spend more clicks for ads to get to that end goal faster... or to pay up front for the ad free version. Anyhow, hope you take this as constructive criticism to make your app better.",

They cater to those who pay, and those who pay little to nothing get the short end of the stick. If im a level 9, why would I be matched with a level 19? It happens all the time. Players should be matched based upon level not trophy count. Players wait to play with a character till they are a really high level or drop trophies than crush everyone else.",

The only major problem is the game is expensive. They lowered the prices of some packages, but you don't necessarily have to pay. One more thing is, they should update the map and make it a tad bigger and maybe add something cool, like places to hide that are harder to take damage, or a teleporter.

But my only little complaint is that the main menu is a bit blank. I dont know if it is because Im new to the game but thats it. It does not have a huge Main Menu like in Brawl Stars or PUBG.",

CONS: Subscriptions are too pricey. Why should I pay the price of a hulu subscription when the benefits dont equal the price? The number of notifications I received claiming my credit score has increased when it, in fact, has not, is incredibly bothersome. I dont like generating traffic for apps that provide misleading information.",

However, when it comes time to place the order, there's a bug that prevents the order to go through. When I call the store to place the same order, they tell me others have complained about the same issue. Should be a simple fix dominos. If I cant finish placing my order, the app is completely useless. Please fix ASAP",
