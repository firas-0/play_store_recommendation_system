My kids are developmentally delayed in speech/communication and although they didn't even get to use it the whole week of the free trial, they have gotten soo much from it. After a year of speech therapy this would be the perfect tool for continuing that progress. So many cute learning videos and games that teach drawing, writing, color and shape matching minigames etc. I'm so sad to remove but you can bet that when things pick back up I will DEFINITELY reinstall!",

Except for the countless times I have set an alarm only for the alarm to start 15 minutes after I had it set, or it doesn't give me the intermediary wake-up time I planned for. It's honestly crazy to me how I have had this app for over a year and still can't trust for certain that I will be woken up when I schedule. I have been late because of this.",

That is simply unacceptable if you don't have unlimited data (which until 3 days ago, I didn't, and explains why my bill was so high until switching plans). last I looked it was $10 to remove ads, now it's $15.

I tried to replace the exercise and the only options were harder versions of push ups. I stopped the workout part way through because of that. disappointing.",

If we could set the max weight we own, that would be awesome. Example: I only own up to 20 lbs in dumbells, but I cannot set that anywhere I find. It always adds extra weight and I have to set it back. Not a big deal, but it can get tedious after a bit. Last feedback: the \"log all sets\" button should have a warning after press.",

No way i can start with that. Some of the weights suggestions are weird. i don't have a 7.5 lb. weight.",

Now they have released a cheaper tier in some regions, including mine, so I was going to give it one more chance... Only to find that it costs 3 times the price I saw adverticed in dollars.",

For instance there is no distinction for muted notes. The songs are meh. On the PC side, keyboard shortcuts would nice for navigating songs (rewind and such). I love that it can use my interface with an ASIO driver. I saw from another review that if you start the trial, it puts you on a one year monthly plan if you don't change it. I looked at my account and that is the case. That's pretty cruddy! I know you want to sell your products but don't screw people over through obscurity :/ Overall, I like the app, but it leaves a lot to be desired.

When the song is finished. I can't even save it to drafts, it only gives me the option to restart which is terrible. Please fix this!",

Rooms are a great way to get that social karaoke feel, and there are so many that you're bound to find your crowd. Duets allow you to tag people to sing with. Love this app!",

Either play games or watch ads. You can get 300 points every hour with ads which is fine by me as that's typically the cost of one chapter. Daily check-ins also give points.",

The one thing I don't like is the fact that we have to pay or wait god knows how long for an event to get points? I think maybe there should be other ways to earn points like daily logins or every time you read [x] chapters. But other than that, it's a good app if you are willing to pay to unlock each chapter after the third. There are no ads too :D",

So much detail and characters styles and abilities, awesome amount of hat sets and cool events, cool graphics etc. but the reason I gave this game 4 stars is Beacouse some levels are literally rigged! I mean some levels, my only issue is that some levels are so hard and rigged, overall the game is amazing. Highly recommended!",

There are no dictionaries for arbitrary jargon that appears randomly. Explanations don't explain the concept in depth, just how to solve the exercise. I had trouble with Mersenne primes and despite finishing the course, I still don't understand them. Certain exercise series are poorly designed and frustrating even if you do understand.

If you're worried about the subscription, recently(or few updates before) they've unlocked all the courses for free users too! Just a downside is that you can learn 2 lessons per day as a free user and cannot jump ahead/skip , but it's still better than nothing! Go ahead and dive deep into the concept!",

        "content": "The app does want money for extended usage because it has a daily limit! But, the plus point is it has no unnecessary ads and no limit based on mistakes, so you can make many mistakes! I would say it's a good app overall... Edit:- The fact that they reply after a feedback really sends a positive vibe, a sense of being heard. So, after using the app for almost a year, I came back to give it 5🌟!",

        "content": "Excellent app for bite sized real learning that leads to better understanding in a whole range of courses. Currently on the free trial but will definitely subscribe. Could do with a \"family plan\" subscription (similar to Duolingo) option that's more affordable than individual subscription plans. As part of a family pla it also needs an option to create a supervised account for someone <13 years old.",
