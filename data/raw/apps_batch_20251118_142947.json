But, I've found work-around which in some ways are better, which is why I think I've stuck with this app more happily than previous to do apps.",

It was stuck in my browser, so when I closed that, all the to-do's were lost.  Then, when I get a reminder on my phone, I adjust the reminder to a later time, but the notification doesn't clear.

There wasn't an option to set reminders, no due dates, no repeating events. It was a complete mess and I'd get so overwhelmed by it that I wouldn't get much accomplished, paper and pen would have been better. However, this app has been my ultimate life saver for my crazy busy life. It's so easy to use and isn't sloppy. You can add a task straight from your notification bar (s7 edge) if you enable that in your settings. I love not having to check it constantly throughout the day because I set a customized reminder with the task. I have this on my phone (primary use) and my computer, they sync without a single issue. My only complaint about this app is I personally don't need the \"Important\" list and there isn't an option to delete it.",

This month, I've been able to book flights, get my boarding passes (and save them in case airport wifi fails me), check flight status, and stream in-flight movies better than the Airtime player ever did. This app works. On top of that, it gives push notifications when boarding starts, and also gave me a push notification to alert me of an opportunity for a free rebooking to avoid weather delays/potential cancellation for a flight the following day.",

While there are a few annoying aspects to the voice- it calls \"drive\" dia and driveway in a somewhat random fashion but that doesn't prevent one from finding their way and the voice is clear and friendly. It beaks down its measurements so you get .70, .75, and .80 instead of .70 and .80. Not a big difference but I like that better. It becomes the first navigation system to vocalize red light information. That's very helpful!",

        "content": "At best, this game is okay. At worse, it's irritating. This is probably the best Power Rangers game since the Sega Genesis game. Unfortunately, it isn't as fun as it could be. The fact that you slowly level your characters up doesn't seem to really matter. You can have a level 6 common, but when you go up against a level 2 legendary, you most likely already lost before the fight even starts. Those type of matches usually leave you at a disadvantage. It also doesn't seem to matter who throws a punch since it mostly seems to be about luck. Sometimes you'll attack, and even though it hit the opponent, it somehow will still miss and then you get attacked like crazy. Maybe that's just me, but it really does just seem like a game about luck instead of skill. Honestly, a Power Rangers fighting game for a home console is something I continue to wait for, but all I got is a mobile \"freemium\" game. Again, it's an okay one, but it does become a mediocre game quickly.",

Your pay to play certain characters rate and your boxes character drop rates have caused me to delete this game twice now. The gameplay keeps bringing me back.

I wouldn't be surprised if there's an algorithm in place that pits you against more built-up players and gives you bad cards to make you lose when you haven't bought anything in awhile. I crush through leagues after a purchase. Then, after a few days without any, I go on massive losing streaks down through leagues I previously dominated. It also feels like the buttons are non-responsive in these times. Even if that last paragraph is all in my head, the fact remains that they make it next to impossible to level up after a while. I regret to say that I spent money on any meaningful progress. No more of that. I gave two stars because the concept of a PR fighting game is awesome, as is the artwork in the game.

They're nearly one hundred characters in the game and all you need is an update mobile device to play it. The cons are, terrible tap control system, a dumpster fire pay to win system that is a rip off, unbalanced matches and terrible online servers. The game can be fun, but the bad out ways the good. Don't waste your money. Overall skip this. After 2 yrs, Its game over for me.",

Just a thought but would make it a bit easier for non-paying players to progress almost as quickly as paying players.",

There are so many problems, such as blocking an attack doesn't give you a punish, because they can block your attack right after and the worst UI and connection I've seen in any game. Fighting games are competitive, and this game takes that genre and makes it luck based. You can't even jump in this game, like come on. Terrible",

They do have a work around but then you only have that one slide/image. I don't like this because then I will have 20 separate slide sets rather than having them combined in one set. if you use the AI upload, it isn't perfect. I tried uploading sheets with terms and their definitions. I think it was like 90% correct.",

Update: When I hit the learn mode an error always pops up. I deleted the app and downloaded it again but the error still pops up. I use the learning mode more then the other mode so could you fix the issue.",

Circle to search works for that as well, but is harder to use and also results in a string of words with no formatting. Lens preserves formatting. To grab a screen of text, press volume up and power at the same time. Then press the share icon and choose \"Lens\" - then simply highlight the text you want to capture. Besides the capture, a search of the text and results are presented. Great job Google!",

It is so beyond helpful in identifying everything from places, species of birds, insects, flowers, etc. that I photograph. It also is great in helping to identify items I own and need to repair, replace, list for sale, etc. but don't know or have forgotten their names (and sometimes even what they are). Kudos Google!",

Trinidad and Tobago is excluded at the start of installation as a result my choice would be to choose a country that I do not belong to or exit the app. My obvious choice, I exited the app and uninstall it. So my first experience was NOT GOOD. I am still hopeful though that things can improve with this feedback.",

        "content": "usually a great app. but it can happen that the bank customer is LOCKED OUT ! for example when changing phone! When you cant log in you cannot talk to customer service! So your stuck. And maybe by some strange miracle after a few months(!) it suddenly works. Or when further details are requested by revolut and the customer submits them, but somehow these infos don't seem to meet the banks requirements. Eventually LOCKOUT occurs. Revolut + Yahoo mail app dont seem to interact.That's Problematic",

Despite sending all necessary information, Revolut ignored and not keen to review all details they have and failed to review my claims properly. I’m owed several €60 rewards for referrals that were never honoured. On top of that, they did nothing to support me in two fraudulent purchase cases. The platform itself is great, but the customer support is extremely poor and unhelpful. Please don't ask me to get on touch again, that is a waste of time.",

I found that there is a way to set a spending limit on virtual cards so it's great. now if we can get the same on the permanent 👍🙂",

I use about three to four different editing apps for my art but Lumii helps with removing backgrounds and adding sweet filters over my already edited photos. I've never encountered an issue while using the app, I'd say go for it. In my opinion, it's the best free editing app there is.",

At first, it let me sign in but wouldn't go past the \"add a channel\" page even though I already set up my channels on their web app. So I reinstalled, and now I can't log in. It keeps giving me a \"whoops, try that again\". So, I guess I'll be sticking to the web version then.",

Too bad for the cryptocurrency investment scams that I regularly receive, and that would easily be prevented if the app had the option to automatically silence numbers that aren't in our contacts. A star less because the backup & restore option doesn't work, neither by phone proximity, nor by backup file, so after a phone change I lost all my previous conversations.",

I don't get notifications when receiving messages anymore. for example, I message my partner and wait for her reply. After a while I go back to message again, and get a notification as I open the app and find she'd actually messaged back within a minute. A messaging app isn't much good if it's not giving notifications to tell you you've received a message. I'd love to stick with Signal, but I need it fully functional.",

You have to relink if you haven't used the pc version in a while, but it's barely half a minute's work. Oh, and unlike Telegram, I have never been contacted by any bots or phishing chat groups. Just don't forget your pincode if you plan on losing your phone, because you will loose your backup. I guess that's the price of privacy.",

There is just one bug: when I make a call, if the other person doesn’t have the app open, they only see the missed call after they log in. If this issue gets fixed, it would be perfect. Overall, in terms of security and simplicity, it’s an ideal app",

Also when selecting a photo to send from my gallery, I only see it in full screen when I select it. If I decide its not the one I want I hit \"x\" and I'm taken right out.",
