Sometimes the exercises can be a bit difficult to properly perform, even with the app's instructions. Also, I'm not entirely sure which exercise sets I should pick for certain purposes. After doing the upper body challenge, I'm not entirely sure where to go next. But I seem to be figuring it out as I go, so it probbaly won't be much of an inconvenience in the end.",

Burning through energy super fast because of the unnecessary items I have to click through. Exhausting really. One example, silverware could be in it's own pop-up section instead of with the food because it's wasting an incredible amount of energy & space weeding through it. Dessert, salad, main dishes from same pot is WAY too much to get through for one order. Otherwise I love the game.",

However, past level 30, the game is almost unplayable without paying real money. Completing any order takes at least several hundred energy so you could go days before having enough energy to complete one or two orders without spending money. I can't even imagine how slow the game progression must be for like level 50+. The fun quickly becomes a boring grind for almost no rewards.",

It's annoying after when you've spent a lot of time working towards a goal only to have what you need pop up in some clear bubble and then disappear because I don't have enough 💎. And, at this pace, it also looks like I wouldn't be able to progress from Lvl 12 to 13 for several months.",

BUT... the energy system isn't balanced. As you progress the orders start taking a ton of energy to fulfill, but you're still capped at 100 energy. Increasing the limit with every level seems like an obvious solution, but for now it's too tedious and slow to enjoy anymore.",

Also, I keep getting friend requests from other travelers byt what's the purpose of this if you can't ask them for energy or anything?.",

I can't play for more than 5–10 minutes at a time unless I purchase diamonds, and it's tedious to wait several hours between sessions only to not accomplish anything because the energy stops regenerating at 100, which usually isn't enough to complete a goal.",

    "description": "If you are looking for an excellent GPS tracker, that can work with Open Street Maps or Google, love outdoor activities, or travel - this is the app for you!\r\n\r\n\r\nRecord GPS tracks of your trips, analyze statistics, and share them with your friends!\r\n\r\n\r\nGeo Tracker can help:\r\n• Making the way back in an unfamiliar area without getting lost;\r\n• Sharing your route with friends;\r\n• Using someone else's route from GPX, KML or KMZ file;\r\n• Marking important or interesting points on your way;\r\n• Locating a point on the map, if you know its coordinates;\r\n• Showing off colorful screenshots of your accomplishments on social networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can view the tracks and the surrounding area in the application using a scheme from OSM or Google, as well as satellite images from Google or Mapbox - this way you will always have the most detailed map of the area anywhere worldwide. The map areas you view are saved to your phone and remain available offline for a while (this works best for OSM maps and Mapbox's satellite images). To record and calculate track statistics only a GPS signal is needed - the Internet is only required to download map images.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile driving, you can turn on the navigation mode, in which the map automatically rotates in the direction of travel, which greatly simplifies navigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application can record tracks while being in the background (on many devices, this requires additional configuration in the system - be careful! The instructions for these settings are available in the application). Power consumption in background mode is greatly optimized - on average, the phone's charge is enough for a whole day of recording. There's also an economy mode - you can turn it on in the app settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeo Tracker calculates the following statistics:\r\n• Distance traveled and recording time;\r\n• Max and average speed on the track;\r\n• Time and average speed in motion;\r\n• Min and max altitude on the track, altitude difference;\r\n• Vertical distance, ascent and speed;\r\n• Min, max, and average slope.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, there are detailed charts of speed and elevation data available.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecorded tracks can be stored as GPX, KML, and KMZ files, so they can be used in other well-known applications like Google Earth or Ozi Explorer. Tracks are stored locally on your device and are not transferred to any servers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe app does not make money from ads or your personal data. To support the development of the project, a voluntary donation can be made in the application.\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful tips & tricks to solve common GPS issues with your smartphone:\r\n• If you start the tracking please wait a bit until the GPS signal is found.\r\n• Restart your smartphone and make sure that you have a \"clear view\" of the sky before you start (no disturbing objects like high buildings, forests, etc.).\r\n• The reception conditions are permanently changing because they are influenced by the following factors: weather, season, positioning of satellites, areas with bad GPS coverage, high buildings, forests, etc.).\r\n• Go to phone settings, choose \"Location\" and activate it.\r\n• Go to phone settings, choose \"Date & time\" and activate the following options: \"Automatic date & time\" and \"Automatic time zone\". It may occur that it takes longer until the GPS signal is found if your smartphone is set to the wrong time zone.\r\n• Deactivate the airplane mode in your phone settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf none of these tips & tricks helped to solve your issues, deinstall the app and reinstall it again.\r\nBe aware that Google uses in their Google Maps app not only the GPS data but also additional data of the current location from surrounding WLAN networks and/or mobile networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore answers to frequent questions and solutions for popular issues can be found on the website: https://geo-tracker.org/faq/?lang=en",

It allows me to keep a very accurate log for my trips: both mileage as well as date and times. I can export all that info and generate a complete log file from the individual files that Geo Tracker creates. Excellent work. Only small issue is the mislabeling on when the track was created (Today, Yesterday, etc., ) But that's a MINOR thing.",

Then, those ads can control your phone and open other windows and other apps. Insane. Predatory. Terrible for the people that actually put time into this game. I can't sit for 20 minutes watching ads for 5 minutes of actual game play. Really. Who thought this was okay.",

Personal wishlist for the app: 1. It'd be nice to have some kind of celebration animation if we complete all our habits for the day 2. It'd be nice if on the Habits screen, I could go to previous weeks. I really like that view, but if I want to see how I did last week I have to look at the monthly view for each habit alone.",

My old tracker just had a target end date. Glad the option to sort the habits manually is coming (or at least that is alluded to on several previous responses to reviews). That would be a good improvement to the UI. I do wish there were a way to synch data across devices, however. The cloud backup option may work for that, but I think it could be simplified using the linked account data. There is also not a \"sync on start up/close\" or \"daily\" option for that, so I'd regularly be getting stale data on the second device upon upload of the backup.",

Like \"Hey, I should go on that really cool app to read my comic,I can't wait to play *Insert game name*!\",You know?Just a thought...but otherwise,10/10! 100% 5 stars! :)",

I don't think it's fair to people who are interested and genuinely want to read the stories on here.",

I know FOR SURE even 50% doesn't go to authors, so 3☆. Also, a 'buy complete comic' button will be easier for those who like me, buy & read (no coin calculations).",

Another is that only very few comics are free which means there isn't a very wide selection of comics to read. (Most of the good ones aren't free). Also they do not use google play, well at least i didn't see anything for google play. Others wise I love this and I think you should download this app because these comics are pretty good!",

In addition, they've also reduced my borrowing limit because I choose not to tip every time - which is quite expensive. If I could afford to, I wouldn't be borrowing.",

My bank does not hold ACH deposits. That can only mean that the processing delays are on MoneyLion's end and they like to blame the bank. I can't yet comment on withdrawals for loan payments or investments, those aren't scheduled for two more weeks. But I'm not optimistic that those won't be messed up as well based on some other reviews stating early withdrawal. Full disclosure: I downloaded this app along with other investment/loan apps for a long term comparison research article.",

I only wish there was a feature where you could pick up a downed teammate and push them to safety that way, you're less likely to get shot while healing if say they died on a hill or something. I also kind of wish there were more skins for characters maybe different camo patterns like desert or even just more grounded, skins, I just can't wait to see what happens in the future.",

No ridiculous costumes, no pay to win. I only play warfare, didn't care for the other mode. It's easily 5 stars for me, but please do something about the repetitive moaning noises when your player is injured, and there's too many smoke grenades that last too long and obstruct vision.",

Gun customization menus are unclear and could be more user-friendly. Would love custom reticles and more weapon overlap across classes. Not sure if there’s skill-based matchmaking, but if so, it feels off. Still enjoying it, but hope for some polish in future updates!",

However, if you get one wrong, you go down by 7 or 8 points, which can make some lessons be half a class period long. It makes me want to complete the lesson so much, I dont even learn anything.

My greatest criticism is that this app does not help parents assign and/or check the progress of students. It just shows the possible topic areas of study, and provides a way to do a mock run through each (basically the same as the student except without being graded). So if you want to \"play\" along with the kid on a separate device, that's all this is good for",

I would like an \"undo\" feature if I am in the middle of a playlist and I accidentally queue up a different song while browsing the app. That way I can just go back to what I was playing without having songs I recently heard.",
