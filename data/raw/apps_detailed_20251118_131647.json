    "description": "When in doubt, go for takeout—Seamless has it all. Plus, fun fact: Seamless is powered by Grubhub! Order food delivery from thousands of restaurants, including local spots and national chains, and get groceries delivered too. Prefer pickup? No problem. Know the fees upfront and track orders from Seamless delivery partners in real time—the only surprise is just how easy takeout can be. \r\n\r\n<b>ORDER FROM THOUSANDS OF RESTAURANTS</b>\r\nWith Seamless, you can order takeout from your favorite local restaurants and everyone’s favorite chains. There are so many good eats out there, but you obviously deserve the best. Seamless makes it easier to choose your next meal with restaurant ratings and reviews. French fries, pizza, burritos, burgers, sushi, donuts—it’s all here, whenever a craving strikes. \r\n\r\n<b>GET GROCERIES DELIVERED TOO</b>\r\nThink beyond your breakfast, lunch, and dinner orders. Seamless offers the ultimate convenience with grocery delivery, in addition to restaurant takeout. Order milk, bread, snacks, and frozen foods, as well as household essentials like paper towels and laundry detergent, from local convenience stores.  \r\n\r\n<b>EXPECT TO SEE THE FEES UPFRONT</b>\r\nSeamless gives it to you straight. See the delivery fee upfront, before you start crafting the perfect food order. Pay your way with credit cards, Seamless gift cards, or Venmo.\r\n\r\n<b>SKIP DELIVERY FEES</b>\r\nThe key is Grubhub+. Sign up for unlimited $0 delivery fees on eligible orders, and enjoy exclusive offers and rewards as a Grubhub+ member.* Try Grubhub+ free for 30 days, then level up for just $9.99/month. The truth is, food tastes even better when you spend less on delivery. See details below.\r\n\r\n<b>TRACK DELIVERY IN REAL TIME</b>\r\nSeamless puts your delivery on the map. Track eligible orders in real time, from the restaurant to your front door, and know the moment your bacon-egg-and-cheese arrives. Every delivery is a special delivery with Seamless. \r\n\r\n<b>COUNT ON THE SEAMLESS GUARANTEE</b>\r\nGet your food delivered on time and at the lowest price. Guaranteed, or we’ll make it right. See details: seamless.com/help/contact-us/learn-about-guarantee\r\n\r\n<b>YOU DO YOU AND SEAMLESS DELIVERS</b>\r\nSeamless serves up a personalized app experience, so you can reorder that feast you’re still thinking about from two months ago. Order sauce on the side, go for extra pickles, lose the onions—Seamless gets you. Are you a regular? Get rewarded when you come back for more at the same restaurants. You can also plan ahead by pre-ordering food for pickup or delivery. \r\n\r\n<b>ORDER FROM NATIONAL RESTAURANTS</b>\r\nSometimes you need a sure thing, and that’s why Seamless partners with national restaurants to offer the takeout food you know and love. Get delivery from Applebee’s, Arby’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle, Denny’s, Dunkin’, Five Guys, IHOP, McDonald’s, KFC, Panda Express, Panera, Papa John’s, Popeyes, Shake Shack, Subway, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, White Castle, and more.\r\n\r\n<b>GET SUPPORT WHEN YOU NEED IT</b>\r\nBurning questions? Delivery crisis? Seamless customer support is here for you 24/7. \r\n\r\n*$0 delivery fees only apply to eligible delivery orders from Grubhub+ merchants that meet the subtotal minimum (before tax, tip, and fees) on the applicable menu page or otherwise indicated on the Grubhub platform. Additional fees may apply. 5% pickup credit applicable on eligible future pickup orders only and is calculated based on the qualifying order subtotal. Credit is not transferable, not redeemable for cash, expires 90 days after most recent credit is issued and is subject to restrictions. Grubhub+ is an automatically renewing membership service requiring recurring payments. <b>After your free trial ends, your free trial will convert to a paid Grubhub+ membership and Seamless will automatically charge you each month at the then-current rate (currently $9.99) plus tax until you cancel.</b> See terms: seamless.com/plus",
