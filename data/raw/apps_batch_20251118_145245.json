Some very popular songs ARE present, but for some reason not the original studio versions, but rather the concert recordings. Also a lot of videogame soundtracks are not in this app, even though something like spotify has them. Hope more gets added",

It then lets you upload your own tracks and, thus, you don't need a music player at all. You can also download tracks or playlists to not use bandwidth if limited.

Put the transfer button in the main menu! Also, removing an old account is nearly impossible. You can add Accounts, but can't manage them.",

Picsart used to always auto-save your stuff even if you discard it, but now it has limited storage and you have pay to upgrade/save. The screen calibration for hand/pen is off too, so coloring/drawing is impossible.",

I would consider fair to automatically renew for another month if you don't cancel, but a year?? That to me is a way to get the most money possible from whomever forgets to unsubscribe.

Every time I try to book a hotel or flight, the payment page shows an error, but the money still gets deducted. This has happened more than once and it’s ridiculous. It’s stressful, confusing, and makes you worry if your booking even went through. How can a company that handles people’s money have such a broken system? I’m completely done with this app. If you value your time and peace of mind, stay far away from Traveloka.",

I don't spend any money on it anymore, but I'd spend $15/month on a subscription if I could read for free. They could even do like Kindle Unlimited and just have a selection of novels available for free with a subscription.",

They have a zero refund policy with an AI generated chatbot response without any option to talk to customer support. In 21st century, it seems like a tactic of a scam company rather than a valuable startup",

Didn't feel compelled to write one myself until a couple days ago when the pop ups became so intrusive that it cuts off any audio I'm listening to and forces me to clear out back to back pop ups while I'm in the middle of getting information on a truck stop. Too bad this used to be a great app. Been using it daily for several years. Guess I have to go find a new one.",

But, of more importance to note is the question of data usage. Be very careful with this app unless you have an unlimited data plan. With a 2 hour journey it used something like 7 GB of data. I apparently did not turn it to off-line mode, and I had not limited background data usage. One of both of these were a major impact. I have used the previous version and I had one similar data usage instance which presented me a problem as I was out of the country and had a SIM card with limited data, which Here completely used. I have found that using Here with the NetGuard app allows for better control of data usage, especially network data usage. The app is good, it is very useful in situations where there is no signal or you do not want to use Network data. But, be careful, pay attention to settings.",

The idea is that you should get a good quantity of leftover things that they would be throwing away anyway, not a small 'value' meal you don't even get to choose what it is.",

I had vegetarian marked and if it wasn't for one restaurant asking me if I ate pork (which i don't eat red meat or pork) would have had all pork based meals.

I don't like seeing random people on my feed when I'm trying to look at me and my girlfriend's workouts, but it's not a big deal and can be easily ignored. I 100% recommend this app",
