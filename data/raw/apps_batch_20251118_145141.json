Not sure if they still do that somewhere, but I miss it.",

Since then I ensure the times are shown. Always shut down and restart if you care also. The App should clear each time and have black radar if not reloaded!!",

Only thing is there ONE cash even though you may have quite a bit of it you can't use it for a flight unless it's covers the whole flight. I think this is ridiculous. You can use any amount off a hotel or a car rental, mostly I book flights.The car rentals can't compare to Costco. The car was $60 more for a 2-week trip in Florida. they are more competitive with that than in the past.",

However, many books that I wanted to read aren't available in my region. It's annoying to see them being suggested to me. If a book isn't available in my region, it's better not to show it to me at all. Other than that, it's a very good app and I see myself subscriping again soon, once I get out of my reading slump.",

Other features could be customize the lapses of time a listener could go back or forward on the book, as of now, you can only do this on 15 seconds jumps. Maybe in the future the possibility to have transcripts in the audio books or the option to do searches by words inside a book. Apart from that, I really recommend it.",

I can tell there are many titles waiting to be released to the app which is a good sign as there are a few popular ones I would love to listen to. I do however have one complaint: There is no report function. I came across a very obviously artificially narrated audiobook yesterday and had no way of reporting it. I really hope this function gets added soon.",

It also requires quite a bit of battery power, which is not always practical when traveling.  However, the biggest issue is the recent geographical limitations. I specifically chose Storytel.se because of  its choice in both Swedish and English literature and now it's becoming more limited! I acquired their e-reader a few months ago and really enjoy it, but it can be used only with their subscription and I am starting to regret my purchase now that I have less choice in my books. There should be some regulation that a subscription to the Swedish Storytel gives rights to the Swedish books. How else can Swedes abroad get access to their literature?

A couple of criticisms though: the catalogue is a bit chaotic, I think a much more comprehensive list of tags and categories should be offered.

Now not only did I unintentionally pay for it, but there isn't a way to transfer between platforms so I can't put it on his tablet. Update: emailed and confirmed that the app *doesnt* transfer between platforms",

Webtoon used to be a fantastic place to discover and read new stories with the option to unlock more episodes a week early(up to a point), but it's become yet another cash grab gimmick that forces you to spend heavy for little reward.",

Now it has ads before the chapter taking up half the screen that cannot be scrolled past, video ads between early-access chapters, in-app currency used to buy early access, and paywalls for comics after they're completed. If you want to read Lore Olympus, just buying the physical books is cheaper at this point.",

I paid for the full lifetime version for the whole world and also purchased all the other extras that came with it, including the HUD, which is pretty cool. I often travel in places around the world where I do not have a data connection, so I have to rely on offline maps. What I like about the Sygic app is that you can actually download maps for entire regions and countries as opposed to only downloading small sectors, which is all you can do with Google maps. However, the app seems to have *one big flaw*, which I consider significant and which is the reason why I’m only giving three stars. The app does not seem to reroute in offline mode. I tried it out on several routes the other day on the west coast of Canada, and there were a number of times where I took a different route than the app suggested. Unlike Google Maps, which adjusts the road immediately even in offline mode, the Sygic app did not do that. Even after several minutes the app would not reroute. The only way for me to get the app to guide me again was either to drive back to the originally suggested route or cancel the route all together and start over from the point where I’m at. I hope they will address this issue in a future update.",

I found this one & made 9 collages. Ads are very short. There's a lot of FREE options. I didn't know there was an icon to zoom in & out until I was done with my last one. It would've been helpful because doing it manually, the photo slips & slides & doesn't stay in its original, upright position. I look forward to getting to know it better.",

There are lots of options, and you can watch ads to gain access to pro features instead of having to pay. 🙏 There are different fonts, filters, stickers, and other photo editing features. Large selection of font colors, you can choose whether otlr not to have a shadow on the text; the sticker selection I'd say is fairly wide. This app makes it easy and almost perfecttt for creating moodboards, and that's why I love it so much. <3 Loving it tons, so far!",

My only gripes are that you can't adjust picture *at all* in instasize mode, zoom in to edit, flip or mirror collage templates, or move outside the photo to grab the editing edge for frames/text. However, my biggest gripe is w/ cropping. First it automatically crops for you so you have to readjust. Then if you have to make changes after viewing, you have to start all over, not just make the adjustments. Still love it though. Pls add seamless carousels.",

There are no chat bubbles with the left/right presentation normal in all other chat applications. There are no stickers.

But def download if you're looking for a good way to text you're friends, it's super cool.",

If you're opening a fresh session, you have a 10% chance of not drawing the charts again. What a fairly useless way to interact with the crypto world. God forbid you have to make a trade in a hurry.",

Everything from the textures on the buildings to the lighting in the maps feels incredibly detailed and optimized—it really doesn't feel like a game on my phone! The vastness of the maps like Erangel and Livik looks fantastic, even when I'm running around. ​The gameplay loop is just pure adrenaline. No game beats this game..",

Be careful if you buy coins, or collect gifts. I had a build up of 32 hints and next thing it was gone once I collected a gift, when you buy coins all ur hints will vanished and begin taking from ur coins. I hope they fix this glitch. This is the reason I changed from 5 stars to 3. I didn't realize it in the beginning N all my coins vanished.",

Ads on chapters, ads before and after chapters, ad banners on book descriptions, ads in comment sections...ads are everywhere! It's just too many ads and disrupts the reading experience.",

I do wish they had a way that we as the reader can go into the settings and change the language automatically. so anyone could read whatever no matter what the author wrote in their native language. Basically where it can translate automatically for anyone and they choose the language they prefer to read in.",

First, the heart rate tracker seems to stop tracking when you have a lot of wrist perspiration, and does not track at all when cycling. Second, it syncs very poorly with Google Fit. Maybe Google intentionally hinders this, to encourage purchasing a Wear OS smartwatch/band? Three years later (2025), and the app is even better than it was before.",

Either way, it's pretty disappointing and drastically changes how useful the app is for users that don't wish to subscribe to yet another service. I'd much rather a one time payment.",

We have now destroyed the batteries on 3 phones; an S4, an S5 and an LG L9. Because of this and for outdoor use, we will be getting IP cameras instead. I love the app and idea. It may be better in another year or two when phones with smart charging are being upgraded and discarded cheap. *Note to developers: If this app could be easily connected to IP cameras as well as phones it could really be a 5 star app.",

Its a great idea for use of old phones etc, but not dependable. At best this might work as a backup or addition to a real security cam system, but I need 100% coverage and I cant justify spending money on something as unreliable as this.

It might be a server side issue? ‐---------- Someone reported an issue that I am also experiencing hasn't fixed yet. A notification stays forever that says \"updating widget\" since last update. It also has an issue on determining location for local weather. Was a good app until this happens. Seems like it is draining battery.",

For no reason, I get daily weather notifications for a random spot in the Arctic Ocean, even though I've never favorited anything in that area (by several thousand miles). The app always opens to a much more zoomed out extent than makes sense (seeing, for instance, several U.S. states). It's been a few weeks, and I have to say the new UI is a bust.",

Third, you close the app after refreshing the location, then when you close it, it goes BACK to the cached location. And from a usability standpoint, having text versus pictures for the data layers is way easier. I unfortunately was forced to update (I had rolled back the update in hopes that this would change). Please fix!!!",

For a while the lightning wasn't working, it happened again somewhat recently but overall good now. Widgets have been constantly buggy though. For one it keeps converting to either light or dark mode and I need to switch back to system default. Also keeps needing to be reloaded and often goes blank or data loading. Now they only load in Celsius. Need a fix for 5 star",

Most of my interaction with this app is with the widget, I have a pixel 3 and there is just too much info in the 4x1 widget, instead of 8 temp, sunshine, wind numbers for each day maybe consider less so that the numbers don't have to be so small, I do love all the info but it's a pain to read, even when I stretch the widget larger nothing changes. Perhaps I'm missing an option somewhere? Also I'd like a rain % rating somehow, maybe the cloud icons are based on %?",
