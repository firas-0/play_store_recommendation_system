Please fix the shop, I see items I want but not in the color I want so I have to wait for another one to come up and it NEVER happens! I have one item I'm still waiting to find again in a color I like and it's been almost a year 🤯 make it like the rest of the shop where when we tap an item we can choose the color we buy 🙏",

        "content": "As much as I appreciate this app, I can't give this app 5 stars until a few things are fixed. 1. The arrows need to go away (they distract my 2 year old into thinking that's where to start). 2. The start of each stroke needs to be defined and highlighted (maybe needs a pencil or marker to drag). 3. There needs to be a way to trace the letters in a continuous motion where you don't have to lift your finger for each corner. Example: the letter W I shouldn't have to lift my finger off the screen four times... Please address these issues and I would love to give 5 stars! It's a cute app with great incentives for littles. I love when my child wants to play educational games like this.",

The most recent decision to change the GUI was annoying, but not impossible to overcome. However the VIDEO ads after every edit were not. It took forever to edit a handful of photos, some ads were unskippable and wasting my time and data. I suggest anyone considering the app to move on. Not worth paying for Pro. Sorry!",

I haven't switched to something else just because the politics of the competitors are bad but it's super frustrating especially considering how expensive it is. can't use it as party music etc as it's so unreliable.",

For instance, I reconnected and kept playing the same song, then when I tried to change to a new song, it disconnected and jumped to the middle of the new song??

I try to keep it on so we can get the free gold after every 4 minutes of play but the ads can be frustrating, especially for a 4 year old. Everything costs quite a bit so it takes a while to unlock things which is why I have it downloaded on 3 devices. Only problem is that it doesn't always let me save my progress on Google play or it will crash while trying to save. It's a good game mostly. I'd never pay for it but it's nice to have.",

I have loved my runkeeper app. It has been accurate to almost the second on my races, milage accurate and I love the way it keeps track of my run history. The last 2 weeks it has been shutting itself off or just losing gps and not picking it up again. My runs have been recorded as 1/4 mile for 1 hour, or 1/4 mile for 15 minutes. It's very annoying. I updated to the paid version this am and it did the same thing.",

This impacts users who rely on quick payments and undermines the overall experience. It's important for Monzo to address this issue promptly, as delays in seeing spending can affect shopping enjoyment. As someone who shops in different shops for a better deal, this can be worrisome. Overall I do really love Monzo it's really easy to use",

Unfortunately, due to a 'bug' in Monzo's systems they cannot transfer direct debits automatically, so expect me to write to 20 companies to transfer them. It is concerning that Monzo can't resolve a bug for such a simple process. It therefore troubles me what other more serious flaws their systems have, if they are unable to support the basics.",

Not the £50 that was advertised. Not even misleading, it's lying to you when you refer people. Do not refer your friends to this expecting £50, they WILL NOT give it to you. Shameful.",

I wish I could connect the app to my Samsung watch which tracks my activities soooo much better than Google Fit on my phone. I always have to correct the steps and 80% of the time the app can't connect to Google Fit (I think it's Google's issue)",

The bar code scanner is finicky, it's hard to scan and choose at the same time without the app losing the item.

It can show ads sometimes, but it won't play anything during your music. also a sleep timer, which works pretty well for me. if you want to listen to something you don't have, you can even search it up on YouTube through the app to listen to it (as long as you have data ofc) 5/5 would recommend. :-)",

I'd appreciate it if the developer could ensure that subscriber accounts are accurately tracked and reflected after upgrades.

I don't have a cheap sound system and I don't have just a sound bar so I know it's not my equipment because this doesn't happen anywhere else. YouTube please fix this issue. Last thing is that there needs to be a already watched this episode option. I have a bunch of shows in my library that say 2 or 3 episode that are unwatched but when I go in it is already something I have seen it just didn't mark it off.

When you're simply looking for a certain turn or intersection this can be an extremely annoying omission. We were a little annoyed with the route planning algorithms when trying to drive through Portland Oregon recently. No matter whether we chose the shortest route, or the fastest route, it seems we got either a bunch of turn offs that were unnecessary, or it dragged us off the interstate onto a bunch of side streets just to make sure we were going the shortest distance. It needs to have some option for, perhaps, the simplest route. When you're pulling a trailer you don't want to be exiting and entering a freeway repeatedly, or driving around on a bunch of tiny surface streets. Lastly, I would really like to see an option for displaying your elevation as you're traveling. That's another handy feature when you're dragging a trailer up a long grade. It can be helpful to know how close to the summit you actually are.",

Then you have to go back and add and add. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. And it keeps locking up when it's initializing the maps. It's just a nightmare. Also, I have 4 phones and only ONE of them got the \"New and Improved\" version, while the other 3 still said I had to pay $21.99!! I put in my identification information and it STILL said I had to pay to upgrade, even though I'd already paid the new yearly price of $12.99, auto renewable, for the one phone that got the update. The price is good, but the product is in the crapper now. FIX IT folks! A.S.A.P.",

It applies to almost all the levels marked as \"hard\", \"super hard\", and sometimes to \"challenge\" levels (but not as often). They are designed to make you do micro-purchases for diamonds.",
