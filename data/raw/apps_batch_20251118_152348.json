The other day this happened 3 or 4 times in the course of reading a long article! Seems like maybe when the home page auto-refreshes, the app is forced to go back to the home page?

        "content": "Myntra has been the worst shopping experience for me. I have faced issues not just once, but twice. The first time, I ordered shoes and they didn’t even allow me to cancel the order for weeks. After almost 3 weeks, they finally cancelled it, and even the refund came very late. I decided to give the app another chance, but this time it was even worse — I ordered shoes again, the money got debited from my account instantly, but the order didn’t get placed at all. This is extremely unprofessionlism",

        "content": "I recently ordered something from Myntra because it showed express delivery and was supposed to arrive within two days. That was the main reason I placed the order. But on the delivery day, I got a message saying there was some issue and the delivery was delayed by three more days. In the end, the product took almost six days to reach me instead of two. This was quite disappointing, especially since I trusted the express delivery timeline. Also, the help center in the app is of no use.",

It is also good for playing by ear practice. You can pay for a month or when you will be using more than the FREE monthly allowance. Super easy to pause subscription when your not going to be using it a lot. I love this app!!!!",

Also, the looper has a function to where all you have to do is hit intro, and it will loop the intro or verse or whatever part of the song you need looped seamlessly. unlike the other apps where you have to painstakingly, find the correct time, and loop it yourself.",

I wish the mobile app had all the features as the desktop app. should definetly have an offline mode, but i guess you can save the stems you want so no big deal. the only issue I found was separating lead guitars. It only separates into one stem. Which is not ideal for some songs that have alternating lead parts (i.e. Hotel California). So hopefully the add automation features soon. overall, Solid app!",

I uploaded \"Iron Man\" and it pulled the guitar out almost perfectly. Sure, there are still a few weird artifacts left over like vocals, but you can barely hear them. I am stoked about this one.",

They embid ads into videos in a way that it extends the run time of a film beyond the runtime shown so once you're past the listed run time, you can't fast forward or rewind without getting kicked out of the movie.

The commercial ads aren't as many and as intrusive as other free streaming apps either, which is great. And MUCH less than over the air TV stations. Hard to imagine anyone who could find nothing on this of interest, day or night. I've had technical glitches here & there but overall it's a very good experience. And finally, 24/7 Columbo!",

It's really weird. Idk what happened but when this issue is fixed, I'll redownload it. Until then, I gotta delete and that makes me so sad!",

It's also impossible to get an agent to talk to in the app support. Said \"1 minute wait time\" and 15 minutes later still nothing. what a joke. Canceling for how annoying it is",

It also randomly freezes and I comes back, and I am dead. It makes it hard to progress. #2 It is SO hard to get the final tier in ranked. It's last one standing and my lag doesnt help.

I've signed up for the beta program and am excited to stumble on forward in the future. . . got two more controllers coming in the mail so I can put others on when they come over and chill . 💪",

With the recent addition of pop up adds after every action, I can say my user experience has reached an all time low. I'm sorry the garage sale community isnt profitable OfferUp, but your not gonna make it better by driving customers away with popup adds. edit: 2 years later, I return, and my opinion has not improved. as soon as my viewing of an item is slowed down by an ad popping up, I don't wait, I close the app.",

I'm reasonable with price and do have room to come down. it's a matter of respect for one another to not just throw out a number they know is completely unfair. the items valued so much more compared to other people's prices. and they know that yet expect to basically steal it. also please read the post. all of it",

Every single time I use the shuffle function, it ALWAYS plays the same first 5 songs. In addition, they only play music from the top 3 or 4 most popular albums. That's not shuffling. My second complaint is when I want to \"queue\" a song, I expect it to play NEXT, not after the 30 pre-determined \"shuffled\" songs.",

This is the app you use when you want to listen to music but really you want to put yourself in a bad mood. Amazon should have stuck to being a bookstore.",

Other than that, utterly amazing music app to use! Highly reccomend :)",

Very few ads except for those that randomly pop up when playing music every once in a while, and for things like getting tokens.

The sound quality of TREBEL is decent/good listening in a car or headphones. Doesn't sound great on a more revealing higher end system, quite compressed. Cannot listen/sample a song unless you download it which kinda sucks but not a deal breaker. Like that you can skip as many songs as you wish without maxing out. Overall a good free streaming music app.",

However, when I was checking the application on my TV during the Canada vs. Uruguay match, the video kept freezing every 3-4 seconds, and the audio would cut out. My TV is practically new and it is a Smart TV, so I am confident the issue is not on my end. Given that I paid solely to watch the finals and the streaming",
