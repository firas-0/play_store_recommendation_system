The first thing Is, the hairstyling option immediately says connection error when I try it- and trust me, my wifi is just fine. The other thing is, a lot of the templates say they are free, but suddenly says it costs money the second you try to apply it. Other than those two things, this app Is great. It's got more than hairstyling and templates. Definitely try it out!❤️",

Opening the app it applied the filter(I didn't know). So I tried to take it off, would have been cute anyway.

It's practically unusable. The best feature of the old app: the My List, is gone. Also gone is the ability to select which region of the globe you want to look at for news. As others have said, the selectable font size is also gone. About the only good thing I can see is the addition of theme choice. Otherwise, an upgrade fail!",

Please get a subscription service that us loyal viewers and readers would gladly pay for in order to get full coverage with no ads. Sometime the videos are slow to play. Carey on!",

If there's (for example) four or more images in a post, I can swipe to the second image, and then swiping to the third takes me to the next post. I'm doing the same thing, wish the app would treat me that way. I can sometimes get around this by clicking the image and giving it focus, but it's super irritating and I wish this would be fixed.",

The reality of the situation is at some point, somehow, you will not be able to play. Whether it's waiting for upgrades, event tickets, level energy, you will not be able to do anything. There needs to be a casual mode without a timer or requirement, so you can play while you wait for redundant timers to finish.",

I've noticed a glitch in episode 11, 11-10 to be exact. The firing control tends to freeze up to become non-responsive.

Most of my favorite characters are assault, and I'd like to be able to change the classes of characters so I can have the T Rex dude and stick man on one team.",

I do love that if you're not happy with items, that they will refund your money without a hassle. I'll continue ordering from Temu, for the prices on mostly everything is quite reasonable.",

Temu is awesome but can honestly be misleading as well. I still enjoy there items though. I also hate their spin the wheel gimmick. I don't think that's necessary because that is false advertising.",

It never works properly — most of the time it doesn’t even log in, and when it finally does, it keeps crashing or showing technical errors. Every update makes it even slower and more useless. It’s really frustrating when you need to do an urgent transaction but the app refuses to open. Honestly, it doesn’t even deserve one star, but there’s no option for zero. SBI should seriously fix this app or make a new one that actually works!",

Still only use the free version so far. I love how you don't need to pay the subscription to put in your workout plan and track workouts. I may upgrade eventually. Love it so far!",

The auto-generated workout plans are legit. They are easily customized, and they make accurate recommendations for progressive overload training.",

Other than that, I like that it suggests new goals for each lift and will build out a plan based on what your criteria is.",

Also, when you enter the address, add name, number without the district and/or country. Naver won't find it.",

I appreciate the detailed info about public transport arrival times and which train door to use to shorten your next transfer time.

I have sometimes had a little trouble with looking up addresses on the app, but I suspect that is because of poor choices in the way the addresses are written.",

Warns of speed cameras (these are everywhere in Korea) and flashes red if you are over the limit when approaching a camera, and more.",

I don't mind the added filters because they're fun but the rest is too much. Leave the excessive retouching to Facetune, I don't need to make my face smaller, adjust the size of my lips, give myself a face lift, etc. Other have also mentioned the portrait mode, and fine adjustments that we could do back then like adjust separate colors, etc.",

        "content": "Does a nice job of editing, but I’m not sure if $29 renewable is really fair, maybe to purchase it outright. Afterall, there could be more to the editing, like giving you greater manual control as well as using sliding bars, and a way to remove a noisy background or at least blur it. Adding a clone brush and eyedropper would be nice. All those stickers are not necessary, maybe teens like them. I’d rather have more powerful editing, and fewer stickers and filters. I also wish that you would make it absolutely clear when you download the app that you will not be able to save your edited photos unless you pay. I thought that was just broken.",

So I wasted my time taking several photos and trying to figure out how to make a 360 photo just to finally realize that there is no option. In addition, once you take pics using this app you cannot share them to your camera roll and they distort image sizes to make it difficult for you to screenshot them to save them to your phone. But I will figure out a way because I was limited on time and didn't use my regular phone app to take the pics I wanted. Once I do, I'll be deleting this app because my android app does pretty much everything this app does plus more. I even took videos. I hope I can find a way to get them off of this app. Ugh!",

I suggest the developers to find a way to have the camera 360 app connected to a google account so when users login, everything will just sync regardless of the device being an android or apple. It should be convenient for everyone.",

What the heck is this balancing in Leauge? A level 5 can be matched with a level 40 which is dumb. 3. If you get an ad the game sometimes blacks out, which means things like high scores and wins can be thrown into the void. Other than that it's pretty fun :)",

And how this game is soo much better is that you can choose a variety of Ninjas and there's challenges in event mode, so why not try this game out? REALLY FUN AND ADDICTING 4 U!! 🥷🎮🗡",

Second is Scoring, whenever I go to an event and after I finished the particular event, the score will go to another event like the score of mayhem will go to classic. I got this on every first play.

You've got to pay like 20 bucks to get unlimited access for just a week. honestly for the same price you could just order k-dramas",

Why they wouldn't just use regular ads, I'll never understand. A couple ads after a few episodes would be perfectly reasonable. edit: apparently they did do ads according to the reviews, lol.

It was set up for 45x (1.5 sec interval, 12 MP image, 20 sec playback and resulting 15 minute record time). I may have had a hand in it, having read it would record in Sleep mode, to save battery. But it didn't. Looks like it took just one shot after hitting the big red record button -- and that was it. Glad I didn't opt for premium. Has a good interface, tho'.",

I checked it continuously as I filmed to make extra sure it was still rolling, and literally minutes before I was done, the app closed by itself. The app had done this three times before, but they were all during shorter stints. Please fix this.",

Good idea to check in on your device every so often to make sure it's recording. As far as I could tell, it was saving output files to /DCIM/Framelapse. It was easy enough to find. One thing I would really have liked to do was timestamps with each frame. I couldn't find any options in the app for timestamps. Is this an option with the Premium version? While editing my video, I found myself getting lost with the days (I figured it out, though), and it would have been pretty cool if the app could have marked the time at which each individual frame was taken. Minor complaint that I'll drop a star for, but other than that, I've had a splendid time using this app. I will probably end up using this app for my next road trip. Solid.",

It's worth paying a few dollars a month. It saves your progess so it's easy to pick up where you last left off. For ppl complaining that it's hard to zoom in on pages, you just have to hold both your fingers down on the page & move them outward a little bit, the longer you hold your fingers down, the more it zooms in.

The main bug I come across is where the next chapter doesn't load from the end of the last. Normally, I can just go back to the chapter list. However, sometimes, the chapter list bugs out at the same time. When that happens, I'm then routed to a random chapter and have to go back to the home page to fix it.",

Also to be able to remove them from the list if you lose interest or dont like the manga. Besides that, its awesome. Manga read well and look amazing. Thanks for an awesome app!!",
