The app is terrible and if you ever try to read on a computer, just don't, it is terrible.  unlike many google apps this one  just never improves. if you upload a book to it, no lie, it then makes you download the book (even if you have it locally already) in order to read it..

It isn't playable on mobile because of how much Wi-Fi it requires, it isn't even sensible anymore, can't play a game without getting disconnected for apparently having bad internet connection when I have good internet speeds... It was amazing in 2015-2022, but now it's just unplayable",

I do wish there was a feature that would allow all program workouts to have a shorter ~20 minute version. The biggest obstacle for me sticking to the programs is the time commitment. most workouts take 45min - 1hr to complete from warmup to cool down. I think shorter workouts would reduce the barrier to entry for so many people.",

You choose a program that works for you. My first trainer wasn't my style and after a week I knew I had to change. So I found a trainer for my taste. Either way they make it easier on you to find what you need. Ohh and the meals amazing ideas. It serves 1 but double and you serve 2. There are apps to help count the fats and caleries.",

I also dont like that there is only 1 leg day and 2 upper body days. For my body type I need a lot of legs - at least 2 times a week, so I have to add in my own workouts for the results I wanna see.

It was also super easy to cancel my subscription any time, which I only did so I could subscribe again for 6 months! I love all the different options for workouts at home and at the gym!",

I like that there are videos to follow as you go along the work outs in real time. I am a visual learner, so it's nice not having to pause the workout to figure it out in a slow video tutorial like other apps. I also like not having to constantly obsess over what I'm going to work out and what exercises to do that day, it takes a lot of stress and anxiety off of your shoulders.",

Connecting to the Fitbit app. There is a way to connect through google but it would be so easy since I already have a Fitbit to link the two. 2.

Another thing that I would like to see is the ability to select all songs at once within a playlist instead of individually. It's time-consuming, just trying to redo a playlist.",

The biggest issue, though, is the payment model. The “free to read” system is misleading – you constantly get stuck waiting for hours (or even days) just to unlock the next chapter, unless you spend money. And when you do pay, the prices are ridiculous for the amount of content you get. It feels more like a cash grab than a platform that respects its readers.",

I recently found myself realizing I'd made it 3 whole pieces without getting one this time! It's BEYOND frustrating. No wonder they have such a high scoring rate on the play-for-point apps. No one would put up with this otherwise. And if it glitches, get ready to start all over again! HIGHLY recommend finding a different puzzle game if you don't want a bazillion commercials.",

I like puzzle games, but this app isn't for me. feels like every 30/40 seconds you get hit with a mid game ad, you can quickly skip them, but it's annoying. just takes the joy out of playing the game. I don't mind ads before and after each level, and even a mid game ad after every few levels. but when it's through the whole game play, I just give up. good puzzles though 👍.",

You can't even ignore it and keep playing. You have to wait for the idiotic thing to go away. This really could have been a great puzzle game. I won't be keeping this.

After that I went to watch a movie on a different service. Cancelling and not planning to return anytime soon. I read some of the reviews and decided to try when they had a promotion.",

When I tried charging it with different chargers, it did not charge. When I contacted support, it showed that the 7-day return period had expired. I was unable to contact the seller for assistance or replacement. I was requested to check for repairs in surrounding stores... This was the worst experience I've had thus far. What if the product didn't function aftr7days over",

To make matters worse, when I re-ordered, they sent the exact same cancelled package again, with the unsealed packaging. This is not my first bad experience, I will never order again, and their customer service is absolutely the worst—a truly useless department that only adds to the frustration. There are only automated messages for everything",

The first explanation it gives is normally quite difficult to understand, but apart from that, it's really been useful for recapping subjects and learning new things. Sometimes, the AI does explain it in the most difficult way possible,but if it was to use casual grammar, this could be even better. Thanks, Gauth, for helping me out.

One of the problems is fact that they removed some features overtime, like being able to snap multiple pictures to provide the ai scanner for more context on the question without trying to cram it all onto one picture. My main problem is the limited use without premium. I understand that it takes money to run the app but you have to remember that the majority of users are students.",

I also wish there was a way to practice your saved words in a flashcard format. Still a great and educational app that is worth premium!!!",

For me, it keeps the fire burning to learn. This game tests you in Speaking, Writing, Memory, Reading, and Math. The way this game builds and utilizes your cognitive function is a godsend to your brain. If you're gonna sit on your phone for hours every day, you might as well use it to better your mental capabilities.",

A good example is the Percentage exercise where you are trying to do one math problem but see other answers under the current one as well as shapes.",

While the supposed difficulty level increases, I keep getting the exact same content over and over. It's dishonest. It helped me a lot, but they just didn't care enough to add content beyond a few months of daily use. I outgrew it. Contacted them multiple times, but no changes.

With that said, I think the pricing of this app is where it loses me. It IS possible to avoid signing up for the free trial and continue as a a free user, but your usage of the app is very limited. A 14 day [2 week] trial period is very short, and $40/year is far too much in my opinion for what amounts to a mobile game.",

I love that feature cause it really has the \"In-depth\" summarizer where it really expands the lesson and now it's gone. I hope you guys are gonna bring it back, it may seem useless for someone but it's very useful for me.",
