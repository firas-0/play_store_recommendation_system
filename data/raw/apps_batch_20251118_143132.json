I'm suspecting they're positioning themselves to sell people's data. So yeah, it was a great app that didn't need much but those days are over. Another bastion of privacy and security has fallen.",

I can definitely texted myself to avoid accidentally texting somebody else so awkwardly. The only thing I dislike was when a random stranger called my number unexpectedly and I had to block him/her. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to connect family and friends instantly. 👍🏻💚💯",

Let me dislike the song and just don't waste a spot on my Playlist with it. Secondly, the my DJ thing would be so much better if it didn't consistently cut off 30 seconds to a minute of most songs",

Overall, the design seems to have forgotten core music playback and playlist organization features entirely. There are lots of other random features I don't use instead of really well polished music player basics.",

Also, while there are sounds available, a lot of them sound somehow generic and cheesy, especially the \"hip-hop\" ones. They are free but, still. Lastly, the editor could really use some work.",

The links don't work, it does not accept mp4 files which is fine because files can be converted but overall the app is just difficult to navigate and does not work in the slightest bit, it'll tell you your podcast was uploaded and then you click on the link or look it up and it doesn't even work I'm truely not sure what the issue is, maybe it's some sort of glitch? Who knows, the app does not work so don't waste time!!",

I also love the feature ,,slide to seek\" and the fact that I can upload movies that I can't upload on other apps. Also, a great feature would be this: being able to mark moments in videos. In a 3 hour long video you want to rewatch/ you're interested only in a 3 minute scene. It kinda sucks to lose so much time trying to find it.",

For instance, the new version makes it really hard to find one's play list. It's also really hard to modify one's playlist. Also, when I search for a show, I want to listen to all the segments of that show, e.g., weekend edition. What I find is that the app keeps switching to all sorts of different media, when all I want is Scott Simon or Aisha Roscoe.",

I manage several different pages where we post several times a day - both picture and video. We always schedule the posts as well. Some of our team has access via iPhone, and others via Android. There are pros and cons to both. I use my Android phone most of the time.... 1. 85% of the time in the past 4 months, I cannot schedule my posts. I either have to post instantly or not at all. I have tried saving as a draft - and again, when I go in, I have to post immediately, there is no scheduling. 2. When I have to use my iPad to schedule a post - I need to back up all my photos, and then download to the ipad. I select my photos to post and I cannot do a write up about them. No verbiage accepted! 3. When I CAN do the write up on the ipad, and I want to schedule the post - I have to scroll through to the end of all the items scheduled to see what the next availability is. On an Android - they show in the order of date (most recent at the top), not the order they were submitted. 4. Let's try to use the computer! The computer will allow me to do write ups, schedule and add pictures - but I cannot add video! So after transferring the pictures and videos to my computer, I still can't do all the posts necessary. Also, I cannot see the scheduled posts in order by date. There has to be another application that will provide consistent and reliable results. This is NOT the answer. I couldn't be more disappointed.",

Even worse, if I rotate the phone, it reloads the entire news story and restarts at the top, so I lose my place. (It's easy to do this accidentally if I move across the room to, say, take something off the stove. It happens all the time.) On top of that, some the news sites limit me to maybe 3 stories a month, and when I rotate the phone and it reloads the page, that counts as another story. I can reach my limit on a single story.

Annoying and frustrating compounded by the fact that as I scroll down to where I was when it jumped the story that I wanted to read is gone. Hope this is just a temporary thing and not a \"new feature,\" so I can go back to giving it more stars again.",

It seems like a free app as it allows you to download and create an account for free, but then you hit the paywall before you get to any content. By pay wall, I mean \"free trial\" which will charge you after. I know myself and my child, taking away apps is difficult and I don't like to pay for apps because I'm a poor millennial 😅 I'm sure it's probably a great app, but it isn't free.",

I mainly use the video generation feature and it's brilliant! there is a limit on how much generations you can make in a day but that's to be expected. plus you get a lot of generations. There are certain things that will get moderate which is slightly annoying but oh well. one thing it's missing is maybe the option to choose how long the video is, because it's locked to six seconds. I'd say I prefer the more normal image generators than the grok one.",

Usually I use Photopea on desktop to edit images but I've never found an equivalent app on mobile that can do quick edits with a rich feature set. I love being able to select colors using the eyedropper tool, zooming in/out, changing background colors, etc. And I LOVE that it offers a one-time purchase fee for $20. I hate subscriptions, and this was so refreshing to see that I finally bought it.",

I just wish that it supports DJI Om 4 Gimbal as sometimes it is not convenient to use the gimbal and control the app from the touch screen of the smartphone. I already started using McPro24fps as my go to video app. I'll wait for the gimbal support and hopefully it will be supported soon. there is no need to have a full gimbal features support, just the basics, shutter button, pan and tilt would be enough.",

It was giving me tons of useless notifications, and I could tell when it crashed when it stopped giving notifications. It also simply stopped running less than a week into my vacation so I have no pedometer information for the majority of my vacation. Can't rely on it to work, can't rely on the information it would give me, just in general not worth your time.",

Which is after doing workouts, it will say that they haven't been completed, and it's very frustrating, especially doing the guided programs, cause it'll say I didn't complete it, so it looks incomplete which is a little unmotivating even knowing logically that I did complete it.

I was expecting something like Ladder (not available on Android) when I downloaded this app, but NYC: Fitness just plays a YouTube video when you select a workout.",

I will be deleting the app and finding something more accurate even if I have to pay for it. I hate to do it but it's too inconsistent.",

I've had to start over already completed work several times now and it is getting really frustrating.",
