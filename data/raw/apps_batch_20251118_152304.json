If you're a movie lover like me and love the fact that copyright laws and ad bull**** don't hinder your watching, this is the app for you. This is way better than YT and as a social media app, it's better than FB and Twitter. Have to give it 5 stars just because of all the hard work the uploaders go through to upload all those movies. You all ROCK!",

Kind of defeats the purpose. You can change the pay back date, but only after you've drawn, and only if you call their number. They also monitor your bank account, and draw small amounts whenever they want. You can't turn that off if you have an instant amount due. Try MoneyLion or Tilt.",

I'd even upgraded my account and linked an account that gets thousands, but nope. Not good enough. Don't waste your time and money!!",

I also play Homescapes, and the best part about that game vs. this game, is when there's a level that is impossibly hard, and you keep trying to beat the level over and over, eventually the level gets easier to help you beat it. Gardenscapes does NOT do this. I have played the same level over 20 times, using all the power ups, and only spending coins on several life refills, and still can't beat the levels. Not fun.",

But like others have said, you'll reach levels that are impossible to beat. Coins are expensive & the amount you earn per level is ridiculously low. I have no choice but to quit playing again.

For those who have never played, to buy just 5 extra moves to complete a level costs 900 coins! It was already extremely difficult. Playrix, you are losing many long-term players.

You either have to drop money into it or play the side game A LOT to gather enough couns to pass the level. 900 coins for only 5 moves unless you waste hours of time losing a level to finally be able to purchase more than 5 moves, going up to 35. It's sad it is such a money grab game, because otherwise it is enjoyable. The storyline & side quest content is cute & fun.",

I don't have enough money to buy the premium, even though it's only $2.99 to buy. I personally think that the levels should unlock as soon as you beat the previous level. But 10/10",

It could probably use a few more fighting moves to upgrade and maybe some hand held non-throwing weapons. One of the best games in the App Store!",

First of all there should be accounts, i had this game on an alt device and lost all my progress which at the moment, isn't a big deal but just to ensure that someone can save there progress is a big deal. Second they need to implement a PvP mode, i dont know if they can or if the combat system would work but if they can it would be fantastic. And make no ads purchasable option. Overall great game.",

        "content": "Great pixel game, it reminds me of older days, and it is probably one of the best pixel games, it's a fun platforming and fighting game, wouldn't recommend for smaller audiences, but it's good, online is kinda wonky and needs to be better but it's still good, I spend my time playing this, the only other problems are how much it takes for another level, and there aren't ads unless you want them (checkpoints have ads but if ya don't want them buy membership), Great game.",

Most of the game (incuding hard mode) is awsome, though the only problem i have is that the last few levels seem to spam forced battles, slowing down the flow of the game. other than this, the game is almost perfect. I do have an idea, a level editor. I have a feeling that this would be very difficult to program. I dont feel like giving any extra ideas, as I feel like it should be up to you to design the level editor, as you are the creators.",

Only two major downsides: 1) Story mode needs more content, a new story to play through.

When answering a question, you can't just reflect on it for a second, because it almost immediately goes to the next question. Navigating through the app is overwhelming and showing lessons that free users cannot access is just distracting. Learning common phrases does help.",

My only problem, I need a way to slow everything down. I can't hear some of the harder words because it is spoken too fast for me to understand each syllable. I would like to suggest some type of slow motion button so I can say the word correctly. Some of the words are tongue twisters. I believe that would help tremendously. thanks",

When it shows only 2 bars (which looks like it would mean the gym is relatively empty), the free weights are already pretty saturated. They need to calibrate it badly.",

        "content": "This app is terrible. So last year I had lost 20 pounds because the trainer at the gym set me up with a plan. There was a file folder at the gym with everyone's workout plans. Gym closed because of covid. I go back when it reopened and was ready to resume. Nope, they threw out the whole box because of covid. As a beginner I needed that information. So all my information on weight loss, the machines I used, settings for those machines was lost. I yelled at them when I see the staff has a file folder at their station \"You better throw that out because of covid.\" Fast forward, and I go back to the gym. I get the app hoping that will help. All it is good for is letting you in the door. I asked the manager if it had a way to record all the info previously; machined used, seat settings, weight settings, progress......Nope. So I said \"You're telling me I have to go through, try to remember what I used for machines, weights, and settings until you guys eventually get a trainer back?\" Um, yeah. So check out the response. They say they are looking to improve the app to have a more in-depth tracker. Eight months ago it didn't have it. It still doesn't have it, and these clowns say \"near future?\" It's paper, pen, and my Body Minder workbook for me. Tech is supposed to make life easier, not harder.",

The art and animation of Pokémon Sleep are very, very charming and showcase well the Pokémons' personalities. There are seasonal and recurring events, which I do enjoy. The main reason for not giving this game its final star is due to how grindy the game can feel, along with how long it takes just to get through the analytics screen in the morning.",

I can't keep scrambling to delete something else that I don't want to delete off my phone just to hurry and update it before I miss my sleep time (which doesn't matter, it doesn't count about four hours of my sleep anyway!",

I've had to put it into deep sleep, but that means when tracking sleep, if I get a phone call or reply to a message, the app will probably close and I lose the rest of the sleep log.

I wish they would still allow ppl to still send money to others, even if you can't afford it/don't have it in your account. And you would then pay it back at a later time, or they would take (owed-money/debt) bit by bit as ppl sent you money, or your stocks/investments gained profits. Was great for paying that pesky bill, or getting that emergency last minute wedding/bday gift. Bring back credit!",

I think that Manga Plus has a more user friendly approach by letting you get up to date on running series for free and only requiring a subscription to re-read *and* making the three most recent chapters free. Here it's a pay by chapter/use free chapter tickets system which stalls your progress if you get *really* into a series. I understand why it's set up like this but it's still really disappointing if you're playing catch up or just trying to be up to date.",

An option to listen to the daily text. 3. Would love to be able to add my personal study notes to home screen favorites. 4. A way to set study/event alerts, like a pop-up in the morning that says,\"Good morning. It's time to read the daily text.\" But I guess we can just use the native phone calendar alerts.

Maybe the seats are made of cardboard and covered with plastic. Maybe the engine falls off before you take it for a spin. But they advertise it as an Acura and as a great & pay half the price.",

Now, you pay a BUNCH of money per week for LIMITED avatars that are sub-par... and the photo editing is absolutely nothing special.

However once done I was very disappointed. I used pics of my gf and most if not all of them didnt look like her. 1 redo would've been nice.",

Not only do you have to \"subscribe\" to the app to use the okay features, but you also have to pay again to use other features within the app! The 7 day trial is BS! I tried the app and attempted to cancel the SAME DAY and I am now being charged the $29.99 subscription and will be canceled NEXT year in December. Now I'm out 30 bucks and stuck with this average app.",
