The reason for my low score is the ads. Of course, you can pay for a premium version to not have ads, but that's not my problem. The ads will pause videos you're watching in other apps. They will make you restrict you from pausing them. I had the GPS on, and the ad lowered my GPS directions' volume!",

You can customize the face to be chubby, but it would look odd on a skinny body. So I suggest allowing members to choose their body type in the beginning or sth. Also have some more variations in the clothing and style. Like a section for hats, one for jackets and scarves, and so on. Maybe also make the room a little larger so we can really make it us more, cuz it I really loVe decorating. You could also maybe have actual places to go on the streets and still be able to see and interact with other people. Like, a mall or sth. Anyways, those are just some cool ideas I had, you don't haVe to do them unless you see fit. I also wish I could see other people's follower and following. I need some new mini games too cuz that box one glitches too much, at least for me.",

Personally, I'd like to keep things with friends and family, and if I wanted I could go public. But even so, status don't really share much, I'd like to see it expanded, perhaps tapping the bubble could bring down more text. Its overall a nice idea, and with some improvements could be a nice new form of social media. Good luck ZEPETO Team. :)",

Look up toomics, and I'm suddenly able to turn the mode off and view the comic with the same exact loging as the app. Overall it just seems like they are trying to get money to view all the comics, pretty unsatisfied about that.",

The app only allows you to view family safe content and it's annoying that the full scope of the app isnt accessible because that's its purpose, convenience. If I had known that I'd have to login to my account online and not use the app at all I wouldn't have purchased a membership. They do have wonderful content but little variety so if your okay with online only then it isnt so bad, but inconvenient",

Episodes stay unlocked, but unlocking a full series is quite expensive, often ranging from 30-60$, depending on the number of episodes. At that price I would prefer to be buying physical copies. You can play games on other apps to get ink, so there's a work around, but the ones I've tried have been very time-consuming.",

I get that the ink supports the creators but I feel that if it was cheaper then the creators would get more people following them, which would make up for the price.",

I have had to cut way back on how many series I read, because those prices are absurd. Until they raised prices this was my favorite web comic app. Ever since they did the update and simultaneously began raising prices it has been going downhill. The comic quality is top tier, but the app was better before the update.",

Firstly, the \"buy\" option for movies on Prime is not a purchase it's a long-term rental as long as you keep paying monthly for Prime. Secondly, if I wanted to wait weeks for items, I'd use Temu, I want to buy American. Thirdly, the company as a whole doesn't care about us(customers). I'm done paying for Prime \"benefits\", they're not benefits anymore and I'll be losing $800 in movie purchases alone.",

The exercises do a lot for the core and the use of the dumbbells is a plus. I'm a mom of 2 & my tummy has never looked better. Definitely eat clean and workout daily and you will see results. My only deterrent is the inability to add on to the times for certain things like the plank. I'll still give it 5 stars because I'm able to amp up my workouts with different weights.",

I love the characters, skills, and updates that keep it fresh. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the best skins and bundles are too expensive—you need diamonds and usually have to top up with real money. If there were more free diamond giveaways, it would easily be 5 stars!",

HOWEVER, I just wish there was a way to remove pets if you equip them, it's soo annoying when I accidentally equip a pet and have to use my next character slot just to have my character how it was before and we only have limited access to 5 character slots. Please 🙏🏽 Make it possible to remove pets after you equip them",

Freefire literally takes like 300 MBs, and still gives a solid experience, while PUBG takes more than a GB, I don't understand the comparison. It's a smooth game, it's best for the people like me, who cannot afford to buy a gaming phone, so yeah, I love it, and will always recommend it.",

So to begin with how this game was used to be in the 2019-2020 it was a game we could not let go off and play another game we would be drawn to but in this new update cool things are getting added new game mechanics high performance..but...sadly it dose not give the vibe we got back then it's still a great game to play but if you could make it somewhat more fun we would enjoy it. But beside the deferens I personally think it could grow but It regularly makes my day.Thank you Free Fire!",

It teaches you the diffrent concepts, and why diffrent letters make that particular sound. It teaches grammatical concepts early on and makes sure you understand everything. It does cost money, but the first lesson is free so you can test it out. I dont normally spend money on these types of things but it is 100% WORTH IT!!",

I use so many different Android photo editors, trying to find one advanced enough to have all, or most of the tools I need, so I don't have to edit on my PC, & that is intuitive to use, w clearly labeled tools & functions. & I really like how the order of tools in the App's layout is customizable. Also, it has a useful # of AI tools, without letting them completely take over, unlike many other Apps. So I think Photo Studio Pro just may be my new favorite! 🍻",

I can't choose to just have a quicker transition, and if I'm trying to match the clips of my video to the beats of a song, I can't do that with any transition.",

There are probably like 30-40 songs in the library, and that's it. And they are not even good. It's a let down, you have to import music from other sources.",

My only minor complaint is I wish they had more dynamic captions. Overall, I highly recommend it for video creators who want a quick but reliable editing option on the go.",

I have tried clearing caches, cleaning my phone and nothing stops it. Out of all my editing software this is the only one I'm having issues with. Sad as other than that its a great app. do wish it had some better transitions though. Tiktok transitions interrupt any music I added during edit.",

I am a disabled person and I am fond of video editing, so if you find it suitable, please make the feature free for me because I do not have enough money to buy your subscription! And the feature that removes watermarks after watching videos is very good, the only thing missing is the pip",

A small lag is one thing but it's literally like 20-30 seconds behind what is happening on screen. Please fix this! ❤️",

They no longer offer that though and instead just play around 260 seconds of ads before the movie begins. So, there's zero interruptions throughout the film once it starts. I love that they have movies available still in theaters without having to pay anything extra. Peacock also comes with xfinity free of charge. Highly recommend and love this streaming app!",

It's really annoying, as they always take precedence over my other shows from other platforms, and can't be disabled. Inside the app, the profiles each show a correct watch history, so its not someone else using my account. I'm being shown \"continue watching\" items for someone else's account entirely.",

I canceled my subscription cause there is no point to keep it now. I wish they would have given me some type of warning over notice that they were taking away the main show I got the app for.",

The one that annoys me enough to knock stars off the rating is that if I miss a couple minutes of a show and an ad plays I can't go back to a minute before the ads without having to watch ads all over again. It's not right to make you re-watch ads to rewind back a couple of minutes. I can see if I started it all over again, but that's not the case. It feels sneaky to me.",

Then, in the middle of my year discount, they stopped the monthly Plus(no ads). Now I am forced to either upgrade at $139/yr or watch ads. Don't have this issue with other streamers.",
