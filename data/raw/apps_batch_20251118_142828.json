I have to close out the whole app. 2nd offline is borderline pointless, when I download a course it goes through this long loading phase and sometimes want even show the courses until I connect to internet first.",

If udemy didn't have such good content, I'd give the app 1 star. I would expect a much better app from a company that has so many programming teachers and students.",

Unfortunately, it did take 7NOW that much time to move a bag of chips and some orange juice 6 blocks to my apartment. I had ordered a pizza but it wasn't delivered. Apparently they ran out of pizzas. No one bothered to call and check on a substitute item though -and when I called the store I was yelled at by the man working there then hung up on. Sweet. The second order was MUCH quicker though. I think it only  took something like three hours to get my food. That includes the hour-plus my food sat in the lobby of my building because no one brought it to my apartment or even bothered to call me about it. Awesome, thanks!  Throughout this there was no one available to answer the 1-800 #,  nor did the drivers' number's work. DO NOT USE THIS APP! RUN AWAY!",

My only comment so far (have only been using it one day) is that choosing the data supplier from those offered is a bit confusing as they all give different data. The most accurate so far is Norwegian source. No UK data sources? So am reluctant to pay for Accuweather but would donate to the author of the app.",

Two things keep me from giving it 5 stars but I will eventually revise when they get fixed: 1. The exercise videos only play during the pauses, sometimes it would be great to see them during the exercise. 2. I once missed registering the rest day, so the rest day and the next exercise day were lumped together and I lost my streak. It would be great to be able to edit days.",

The workouts will gradually get harder, and that is what helps you get in better shape. Vise versa if they are too easy. It does take a subscription, so beware of that.

Also they have specializations now that don't allow the best combos of gear sets or allow duplicate weapons in loadouts. Money grab and constant ads. I am deleting the game and never playing again.

If you're willing to spend $100+ you can win some games very easily, others who want to earn their weapons suffer because of this. Recently spent multiple hours on end playing an event to unlock a gun, and even caved and spent money in the final couple days. Was very disappointed to find that as the event goes on, your odds drastically decrease in winning, and my money was wasted. 995/1000 pieces, and 12+ hours wasted.",

But all that is meaningless in a game that is so extremely pay-to-win, it doesn't even try to hide it. Thus most of your games will be completely lopsided to whichever team has the player with the most decked out weapons and armor thanks to being able to upgrade them with in-game currency or weapons and armor exclusive to premium currency. Its the only game I can think of in which getting the first shot advantage means nothing if the other player can wipe you with a single bullet from their premium guns. Absolutely atrocious balancing.   Don't even get me started on the progression system, which compared to most ftp games, is the slowest I've seen in any game ever. On a good match you can earn 100-200 bucks but weapons cost around 40-70,000 bucks and the daily challenges barely let you scratch 1000 per day. Its obviously designed to get you to grind or pay premium to expedite the leveling process but the former is way too much even by ftp standards, taking 20-30 hours and still not get a single new gun.",

Really a shame tho cuz there arent many games with this kind of multiplayer in the PlayStore.

Then I stopped playing for almost a year, and when I came back, you can see in ny past review that the game was still fine except for some minor bugs. I stopped playing again for almost another year and now I'm suddenly helpless. Everyone was literally just one shotting me because they had super OP weapons. I could barely get 2 kills in a single match.",

Sometimes I wish it were easier to get better guns but that's the greed in me. You have to win like 50 battles in order to upgrade or get enough fragments for the better, special, guns.

You gotta grind and im okay with that minus some where it would be probably easier with a full team of friends to help out if you play solo like i do.

Additionally, notifications for tasks have become very hit or miss and regularly show up late or not at all. I really want to like this app, but I'm finding myself more and more frustrated with it.",

I would recommend this app for it's free version but I will admit that I got the Gold plan for $40 a year.",

For example, using the AR feature, it only works best when the plane is close, because the arrow is always pointing at the wrong place, and the box is covering the plane on camera. And in the feature, it has a tiny map with a slide to have the radar look farther for planes, but they always show the plane facing the wrong way, so I think it's going my way, but it isn't.",

It applies to both the app and website, gets rid of ads, and unlocks a bunch of neat features. I'd say the more expensive one is for pilots since it has some of the finer details.

However, the train track builder needs to be edited to have challenges pop up on the SIDE rather than through the already made tracks. My son is currently in tears because a river just got added to his train tracks and sliced all his tracks in half, making none of them connect. I realize it's supposed to be a challenge, but it doesn't have to destroy what he already made. Please fix this. Thank you.",

        "content": "This is a good app and it's used a lot by our five year old. My only issue, much like the video app, is the data usage. Make SURE you have a WIFI connection or unlimited data. Frustratingly, this app also has issues disconnecting when minimized (currently on Android KitKat, though this has been an issue for awhile now), so you can't be sure the app isn't drawing data unless you manually close it out of the tray. For example you can minimize the app and turn off the phone, but occasionally it will randomly start playing music from the loaded game even when the phone is in \"sleep\" mode. It's still a good app for kids, but you might have to have some rules governing when it can/can't be used and make absolutely certain it's been completely closed out when your child is done or you can kiss your monthly data goodbye.",

There is a maximum amount of games it will allow you to keep at one time, but you can't choose WHICH ones to keep or get rid of. The only option is to erase ALL of them and start over with none, if your kid decides they want to try a new one that they don't have yet. Either getting rid of the cap on the number of games, or at least giving an option to manage which games to keep would be nice.",

But for the past 2 days, every time he tries to exit a game to play another, which- let's be real- can happen every 10 seconds because he's 3, the app freezes. It just stays on that hot pink loading screen without changing while I have a toddler on the verge of meltdown because he wants to play and can't. Fix the issue and the app is a solid 4 stars. (Because not all the games are always available.)",

So I registered so I could then transfer the refund to my ban account but the problem is that the app will not recognise me in the security checks. My RUT seems to cause no problems so I guess it's the facial recognition that fails. I've tried over ten times now and it never succeeds. I begin to suspect this is a deliberate way to retain my cash and wil take legal advice soon",

Whenever i download a song where the title is in another language, the foreign letters show up wrong, and not accurate. i would not be as bothered with this if we had the option to rename our tracks, yet we cannot. If renaming our tracks and renaming artists was available, it would be a lifesaver.",

The removal of it was rather unecessary and brought down the rating. Another thing is the Spotify; it's useless to have it because you have to download it in order to work. My suggestion is that either remove it or allow us to connect our Spotify accounts with it so that we don't need to download the extra app. Lastly, please allow us to change song pictures!",

A pretty \"Apple\" kind of thing to do and it doesn't feel good, since ads are on everything else and it would be nice to not have them in my personal music collection. A lovely app but the ads do kind of ruin it.",
