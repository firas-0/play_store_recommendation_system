Already lost a few pounds! Anyways onto the cons...  So when I did the chest workout today it made me do backward lunges.. Now I am not a physical therapist by any means but last I checked that didn't have anything to do with chest? When I first started using this app it didn't warn me how fast things would be moving forward. You go through these exercise sessions within 10 or less minutes! There was no warning as to how fast and intense it was going to be. Granted, three days later I got used to it, and it has probably helped amazingly! One thing I would change is to at least let people know what they are getting into.   I love how there are animations showing how to do the exercises, and videos if you need more detail! I think this is the smartest and most amazing thing the devs have done! This app also has a meal plan, and the diet may seem barebones at first, but then I realized this is probably what an actual normal person eats lol.  I would give 5 stars but there was that issue with wrong exercises! 8/10",

I particularly like how if we miss a day, it wont show as a big red cross, but it rather accumulates the days we exercised on the calendar. The only reason that I am not giving a 5 star rating is because of an ad I saw just now. I am not sure if you have control over what ads are shown, or if Google or a third party does, but the content of the ad was sexually inappropriate.

It constantly chooses the busiest routes, often takes you in the wrong direction, and ends up wasting your time and burning more fuel. The support team clearly couldn’t care less about users. Thanks to this app, my friend's car got stolen—just because it led him to some sketchy, out-of-nowhere location. Installing garbage like this is nothing short of foolish. Avoid it.",

I cannot log in at all, that screen just never shows up no matter how many times I open and close the app (which previously sometimes worked to re-set it). So I had to log in using my phone's browser, and it made me type in the \"captcha\" EIGHT TIMES before I could see my accounts. It shouldn't take this many minutes of frustration just to log in.",

        "content": "I use this app nearly every day, and paid for the in-app purchase. I'm generally very pleased, but I'm downgrading to 3 stars for some behavior that has been frustrating.  I set the timer for an hour, and then cease meditation after 5-20 minutes. I wish there was a count up option, but this was fine since it still logged it. I've seen it said that this would be changed, but 1 star off for it combined with the below...  When I do this, it appears that sometimes the log isn't transmitted to the server until some time later (this may be because I close and swipe from the drawer pretty quickly) but my consecutive days keeps getting reset to 1 if I meditate near midnight and this happens, since it's recorded as if I meditated past midnight. This ruins the gamification aspect of the app, which is a huge part of it. If there was an API to easily download the CSV I'd just do my own processing and start a day at four of five in the morning (which would capture the spirit of consecutive days for me better anyway) but I have to manually log in to grave the data, so that doesn't work either.  Update: the CSV they provide rounds down in minutes, ick. Better than Clock, but switching apps now.",

Also lost all of my journals, so much for my years of journaling my progress. Those used to be a great resource, now it's been taken over with constant pushes to buy premium on every screen, which destroys the relaxation point entirely. I'd be ok throwing a few dollars for a paid version but making it a subscription is too much especially at $60/year.",

Nowhere during purchase was this limitation mentioned — extremely misleading and unethical. Please stop advertising it as “Ad-Free” when it clearly isn’t.",

Since the \"about this app\" is purposely made unclear, here's how offline maps work for the free vs paid tiers: Free tiers - you get one map of one whole country. The size of the United States map at time of writing is just over 33gb. Once downloaded it will regularly update. Paid tiers - you get more downloads and aren't forced to download entire countries. I think it's very scummy that the app does make this clear as day in the store page.",

I’ve now switched to OsmAnd+, which I bought outright, and it gives me far more control and freedom. I’m much happier with it and will no longer use Mapy.cz.",

There are other weird, hard to describe things like this too. Editing text is probably the worst part of the app.",

Material is quick and the lessons are short, but it's a good refresher if you already know coding. Searched for Lua and got Python instead, though, and thr constant nagging for me to get premium is outrageous.",

The app chooses it for you and locks you with that method. Having unpredictable flow to do the activation leads to an amateur and terrible user experience. In my case, I prefer to activate it at the ATM.",

I had to update my review, I originally gave 5 stars but I have to take 1 away because the app no longer connects the Google Fit to track workouts.

Yes, you can log workouts and track history; however, this app does not support supersets (of any type).

Additionally, there is not support for logging cardio like treadmill or elliptical (yes, you can add those as custom, but I need custom fields for tracking distance, resistance, etc.). Finally, the app does not keep the screen on (nor does it offer the option to do so). Each time I finish an exercise and go back to my phone to log the set, I need to unlock the phone.

If you try to fast forward, another 2 minute ad, then restart. Truly, they value their ad revenue more than the customer experience.",

I would *love* to be able to see the mood by hour throughout the day for daily energy tracking and such. I think it would fit in beautifully with the stated goals and purposes of the app. Other than that, it's very nice, and I would definitely recommend it.",

It congratulates me when I make an entry which makes me smile and motivates me. Edit Oct 3 2024: I still use this app every day. It's been instrumental in tracking my mental health and I also use it as a diary with photos and notes. I will always make sure I have this app linked to my device.

        "content": "Once you get up in scores in the 15/1600's the game flat out cheats. It doesn't matter where you aim the bubble and keep the line on the exact spot where you want to go, the bubble won't go there. It gets worse as the game goes. The game will change it. Additionally, the way some of the reward tools work also change at the whim of the game. You will not find them doing the same function each time. That's cheating.",

For 2 days, this app forecasted clear skies at night, and it was actually overcast for one night and most of the second night. And the temperature at night was off by over 15°f. It forecasted the nighttime Temps to be 16°f & 11°f and the nighttime Temps have actually been 37°f & 39°f (respectively). This much disparity between what the app reports and what the weather was in reality renders the app basically useless.",

This is a well-thought out & nicely designed app with great features... sadly presenting unreliable information with false precision! The ECMWF model is optimised for broad brush, what's it going to be like later in the week forecasting. It can't accurately tell you whether you'll need an umbrella in Dibley at 3:30pm today.",

Giving control of the speed of the forecast can also help make it smoother and not so jerky + time label at top through the progression so we can easily see time:forecast position.",
