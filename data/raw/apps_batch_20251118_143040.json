It changes automatically after you completely clear a board, and I just wish there was an option to pick specific colors/themes.",

If you can't figure things out from the instructions on this page or the app itself, then a simple Google Search will show you what you need to do, and there are a ton of settings not enabled that need to be to work properly, but once setup, it is amazing. I suggest having the always on top feature enabled by default in the installer, because why would you start directions and not want it to be the top thing you see on your phone without having to dig through to the NP app and start it manually?",

    "description": "Get to a healthier and more active life with the new Google Fit!\r\n\r\nIt's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\r\n\r\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\r\n\r\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\r\n\r\nTRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH\r\nGet instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.\r\n\r\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\r\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and Steps goal. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\r\n\r\nMAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT\r\nIf you walk, run, or bike throughout the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Want extra credit? Turn up the tempo on your walks by starting a paced walking workout and stepping to the beat. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points you earn.\r\n\r\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\r\nFit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress.

And most of the time when I open the app it still takes 30 seconds or more for it to update the count. And sometime it won't update at all. Frustratingly, sometimes the app will decrease the amount of steps or heart points that you have earned. If you are trying to maintain a streak of days where you've made your target this can be very demotivating.",

At least the other app I use actually investigates it and gives you a chance to defend yourself. is crazy that someone can just report you and band your videos. Please fix this problem and I'm obviously not the only person thats complaining. If this doesn't gets fixed soon then I have no choice but to delete the app and just stuck with YouTube and my other Apps. Why put all this effort into an video for it to be taken down just like that. And it would be nice to get some type of response because you seem to have a really good app and I do luv it but I will not put up with this. Do you have a solution to my problem or at least working on it to fix it? Besides my issues I like all the filters and effects and great people you meet through the app. Thank you !",

Just don't install this app.",

Not saying others aren't just as good, but this is by far my favorite 👌🏼 Pilates is such a great low impact strength training for someone like me that has limited mobility/use of my lower extremity. And I can adjust my rest time and the amount of time I want to \"hold\" or \"continue\" the exercises.",

I play this at school sometimes, and other classmates can agree, some of them even quit because mostly everything needs membership. I understand you need to make money, but, if you want to have more people playing your game, make it fun and free!",

The game crashes on my phone, regularly. It's a newer phone with gear connection. Others have this issue, so the designers need to fix this, especially if they are going to hound us for money. 2. The constant reminder for membership. I don't mind that you want to pay the employees. That makes sense, but it's all very excessive. Aide from every other move telling you how gear being a member is, there are FAR too many perks to be a member. So much content is locked otherwise. I have gear I can't wear, a lot I can't do. For a learning game I think it's a pretty cheap shot to have it a Pay-To-Win game. It's designed for children. I'm assuming most don't have 5 a month. Fix the connectivity and revamp and calm down the member system, and this app would be 5 stars.",

I sometimes have questions that I want to ask my fellow wizards, and this would brighten our day!! Trading. Ive been thinking about this for awhile. What if we had trade, where we could trade for a wand, hat, buddy, or something else? Maybe even opening our own little store in our profile!! I really want the Cat Ears from the Membership November box, but I can't offer anything for it. I think trading would be a great way to earn currency or certain items. Problems with Membership items. I have a couple membership items in my inventory, but can't use them. I feel we should be able to use these even when we don't HAVE membership, but they're legit floating around in there. I also think that some items that are membership-only are TOO MUCH!! Maybe for some items, it costs less for Members, but the full price for us non-members!

And when you crash, you have to start at the previous saved level. I find this really inconvenient because I only have membership for a few days and I want to reach level 100.",

Combining customizable characters with adventure, battles with monsters and the ability to play online with classmates, it's an absolutely perfect way to get your grade-schooler to WANT to learn math. The problems are appropriate to grade level while also throwing in some easy ones to keep their minds sharp (and remind them of how much they've learned). It's a math game they ask to play!",

Something that takes up that much memory should be able to be saved to a memory card. But, I won't delete it because I use it too often!",

        "content": "I direct deposit the qualified amount every month for free checking, but Chase still makes you track your own transactions and forces you to keep a paper ledger! I'll tell you why ... I've a Chase bank account for over 7 years. I've had very few problems but there is one GIANT problem that they seem to never fix. In the app, you can have dozens of pending charges for several days such as up to a week! These are simple purchases from say Walmart. Of course the pending amount is supposed to be included in the calculation of currentl available balance, but it's definitely not. This issue has cost us hundreds in insufficient funds fees because the app will show that you have say $500 available balance while displaying the pending charges in the order they were charged. So using the debit card we would go buy fuel and other purchases within the $500 balance, the next day we would be overdrawn. Why? We'll come to find out after speaking to a banker and showing him screenshots of the ledger shown on the app, his ledger on the chase computer is totally different. He had different transaction dates and order, he had more pending charges than what I was shown on the app, and his displayed the ONLINE TRANSACTIONS. That was the kicker, chase will allow you to spend money with the debit card even though your account is negative if you have pending online transactions and they will display a positive balance on the app, thus allowing you to overspend your budget and ultimately pay insufficient funds fees of $34 per transaction. This happened not once, but 11 times before we switched to a different bank account. The new bank's app does not opperate this way.",

        "content": "I've been using this app for a while now and it's serviceable -- I prefer reading on a tablet and it's easier for me to read that way than on my computer so I like being able to download manga to it. It's pretty bare-bones but more or less does what it needs to. Generally I make purchases from my computer then just use the app for reading chapters I've already bought and want to access offline. That said, there are a couple of things I'd love to see changed: 1) Be able to queue up multiple chapters for download instead of having to do each chapter one by one. There's a lot of going back and forth and it's really tedious if you're trying to download several full volumes. Either being able to queue up 5-6 chapters so you can get a whole book at once, or being able to bundle all the chapters of a manga into one volume and download it that way would be a big quality of life improvement. 2) Save downloaded chapters to your device's expanded storage. I read on a tablet that only has like 16gb internal storage. All the other apps I'm using that download content for offline viewing can be set to use the SD card for storage and not take up space which is nice considering how limited the internal storage is. This app doesn't seem to have this functionality so I have to delete things frequently (and considering how tedious it was to download them in the first place that's a bit frustrating).",

The only other downside I've found is that you need WiFi to use the app, it won't work using your data.",

I believe it would really bring more consumers if the app is more modern design and the transition is faster and smoother to the eyes. Plus the pink menu is confusing , e.g. when signed in, there's no Sign Out button only Sign in. The only part is well design is reading, I like the option of flipping page and scrolling down the page. I hope Renta read this as I really look forward to the improvement of this app. But right now , I mainly using other companies' manga/comic app.",

Side note: It's not a big deal but using emojis in comments would be really nice. Sooo! This app is very clunky when it comes to its user interface however, it works. One major problem I run into is buying points. I have to try 3 to 4 times, and refresh or start over again (using paypal).",

Multiple calls to cust service, no fix yet. Saga: Couldn't register new card via phone--it says invalid card number bef Im even done entering. Registration via phone fails, but it tells you to use the app or website instead. But neither online method even offers card registration! It shows my card has been delivered, but there is no registration link or navigation! Who designed this failed process that should be simple!

I don't mind watching them when I'm actively watching an episode, but I was trying to skip to the end of an episode to see if I've seen it before, but I had to watch the initial ~11 second advert, then a ~2m 11s advert before I can check. No thanks. Adverts are also messed up if you wait a day. I part-watched one episode and watched the 2x ~2min adverts as part of the episode, then went to bed. The next day I had to watch the adverts again. What a mess.",

Every other level is a nightmare level, which almost always requires you to use perks to beat it or you lose any buffs you've earned. They also do contests, so you can try to win perks, but they change the advertisement later, after you've spent money, to say it was just a qualifier and not the prize. Absolute scam. It's so frustrating I end up not playing for 6 months at a time.",

Benefit from the following main features:\r\n\r\nMOVING MAP\r\nPlan and navigate using our interactive moving map. Choose between aeronautical charts, satellite or our vector map as a background. On top of that, the moving map displays waypoints, NOTAM, obstacles and airspaces from our comprehensive, always up-to-date worldwide aeronautical database. Tap on any waypoint directly on the map to easily create a route. Personalize the values shown on the navbar to have exactly the information you need: altitude, vertical speed, bearing, distance to the next waypoint, ETA calculations, etc. Choose the airport departure and arrival procedures for your route to have them also displayed on top of the moving map.\r\n\r\nENHANCED TRAFFIC AWARENESS\r\nGet visual and audio alerts in all languages for nearby conflicting traffic. Choose your preferred traffic icon between generic, aircraft or TCAS symbols. Your safety is important to us, which is why we partnered with SafeSky to ensure our users have live traffic data during their flight. Benefit from the native integration with SafeSky included in our new Smart Lite, Smart Classic and Smart Advanced subscriptions—a two-in-one package!\r\n\r\nADVANCED WEATHER LAYERS\r\nIn addition to the basic weather reports of winds and TAF/METAR for your flight, subscribers of the Smart Advanced plan can activate see-through weather layers on top of the moving map. Available layers include rain radar, wind, pressure, clouds and rain, visibility, gust and additionally for Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Balkans, GAFOR reports. Tap on any point on the map to see the weather information for that area. Review the weather forecast for up to three days ahead.\r\n\r\nNOTAM\r\nAfter creating your route, set the departure time in the future to have the moving map display the NOTAM active for that specific time. NOTAM on the map change color dynamically based on their status.\r\n\r\nSMARTCHART\r\nOur cutting-edge SmartChart is a highly detailed and intelligent vector-based map that adapts to your needs, providing you with adequate information at any zoom level. The SmartChart optimizes the display of shadows to easily distinguish between valleys and mountains, and the text remains perfectly aligned, guaranteeing optimal readability. Including the latest significant improvements with forests and detailed airport information.\r\n\r\nELEVATION PROFILE & SYNTHETIC VIEW\r\nEnable the profile view below the navbar for enhanced situational awareness of the elevation ahead of you or along your route. Choose the corridor width between 0 to 5 NM and overlay options: airspaces, NOTAM, obstacles, wind components, populated places, etc. Switch to the synthetic view for additional terrain information, plus an artificial horizon with altitude and vertical speed indicators. This function can also be used to pan around while preparing for your flight. Activate TAWS on the moving map as well as on the synthetic view.\r\n\r\nAERONAUTICAL CHARTS & APPROACH CHARTS\r\nWe offer the most extensive worldwide catalog of aeronautical charts, including the ICAO charts.

Now most deals are \"limited\" and I've never actually had one go through. While their CS is a tad better than it used to be, I still find it frustrating. The refund system has kinks in it, although I do like the automation of it. After I get my full refund I'll most likely be deleting this app. I'd rather pay for things I want and actually get them.",

My only gripe is that often the price is only for a particular size or color. Be aware that most clothing you will want to order 2 sizes larger that you would generally order (unless you're tiny) and be aware of shipping prices. Most of this is coming from China so it costs a bit for shipping and takes a while. Overall though, I'm pleased with the site. Watch out for some items that are great in the picture but slightly lesser quality when you receive. Go by buyers photos when you can.",

I listen at work, so I have to pause frequently when I'm talking to co-workers; the video plays when my screen is locked, but it doesn't respond to media controls - when I press pause on my earbuds, the video doesn't pause. Also, the video player doesn't have any controls for seeking forward or backward, and doesn't display a timestamp when manually scrolling the progress bar, so it makes finding your spot difficult. Additionally, it doesn't remember your spot when leaving the app. The audio player is more functional, in that you can browse through the rest of the app while listening, unlike video. Also, it has 30 second forward and backward buttons; it would be nice to be able to change the size, but I don't really care as long as it has them. It does respond to external media controls, so I can pause from my earbuds or car system. The big problem here is that the audio is the unedited podcast version - i.e. ads included, and no bonus content on the Sunday special. Essentially, it's the podcast version I can get for free anywhere without paying for a subscription. Another missing feature is the ability to download episodes; I'm on unlimited data, and frequently have access to Wi-Fi, so this isn't as big a deal for me, but it would be nice to have. As far as the news articles go, they work really well - clean layout, easy to read, no ads whatsoever. The only thing missing is the comment section; I don't typically comment, so not a huge deal, but I do enjoy reading them. If they had better controls for the video player or the edited ad-free audio version, it would be 5 stars, but as it currently stands, it's just mediocre.",

Another reason is the lag of time. I don't know why the time sticks at a certain point and after 2 or 3 seconds, it suddenly jumps to a large gap. Also,, the premium subscription is really too much. I understand that earning money is necessary for the developers. But I still request to reduce it. I hope they understand it 😄",
