Im very thankful for it (when it's working properly) because evidently my household can keep track of a single remote. I can't even find the remote I just bought. It's still in the box🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️. So I, and other family members can use the app as a remote when needed! Thank you roku😘",

I'm not sure there's a way to make these operations possible with the app through a streaming device though.",

It is also easy to switch between, and name, all units in range. It is very much recommended for me.",

However, had an issue with the delivery of one items, I was really sad to see how they responded to their regular customer and their issues. Customer service is horrible. I feel the products and prices are what makes the app worth using. Otherwise, I have never experienced such a negative customer service from a top website. Really saddened, now I'll think 10 times before before ordering.",

For this issue, they ask you to reorder the product, which shows again 15 days of ETA. What's the point of reordering when this would be repeated anyways?

When I’m logged out, the prices are much cheaper, but after logging in, they suddenly increase. This is really unfair and confusing because there’s no sale or offer mentioned anywhere. Prices should be the same for everyone, not higher for regular users. I used to like Meesho for its affordable products, but now it feels dishonest. Please fix this issue and make the pricing fair for all.",

The issue only appears when I try to track my heart rate via the Peloton app to get my strive score. The timer on the watch app is also sub-par and regularly gets stuck, so it makes it impossible to track my time while working out.",

Once I click to go buy it on the airlines page, it's $1,000 more. Unfortunately this app has become just another scam. It's a true bummer.",

As a bicycle commuter, I need to be especially attentive to rain predictions and (more in fall and winter) the possibility of falling temperatures during the day, so I can dress appropriately. Your \"Chance of Precipitation\" chart is great for the rain issue. But your hourly temperatures (since they're just a series of number) make it easy to miss falling temperatures that might affect my afternoon commute. It would help me (and, I suspect, a lot of others) if you could create a line graph showing temperature for the next 24 hours as well. Ideally (for me) this would be superimposed on the \"Chance of Precipitation\" chart -- but, of course, it could be a separate chart as well.",

But please, add a feature where we can select what alerts we get notifications for. I don't need my phone whistling at me every 30 minutes for a Coastal Flood Watch.

Initial setup is a bit complicated, the interface of adding my favorite folders could've been simpler. It's biggest advantage over other apps is the ability to access SD Card on modern Android, other readers either can't do it, or so clunky that not worth using. I have SD Card with 100Gb+ of comics, my tablet won't even fit that much in internal memory, but this reader solves it for me.",

Letters, numbers, math, reading, and theory are all categories you can choose from. They also pull from Super Simple Songs which my son is familiar with so that was a fun surprise for him.

I love super simple songs & the way it is implemented in this app is wonderful. I even sent this to friends. The best part is it is free and has no ads. Keep up the awesomeness!",

IMO Khan Academy is better organized, more robust, more engaging, and it's FREE!   It's based on Head Start Early Learning Outcomes and Common Core, and provides a great series of lessons and activities to teach the alphabet, numbers, reading, and logic.  I'm absolutely amazed at the quality of the entire thing and would highly recommend it to anyone with preschool, pre-K, or Kingergarten age children.",

The newest update broke the game to where my navigation bar for my phone, is overlaid onto the actual game navigational controls themself. So it makes using the navigation in the game, almost impossible. I feel there should also be an implemented 'hold down on the +/- to increase/decrease things automatically.' But really the biggest thing is fixing the navigation bar stuff.",

Taxes also are new and further ruin the feel of the game.",

I do think there should be a way to get ride of ads however, such as 5$. Overall a great game.",

When I pay for a yearly subscription, I shouldn't have to pay extra for deliveries, and there shouldn't be any catches. But with Noon, it's just a waste. You pay for the yearly sub, and then you still have to pay extra. Seriously, don't bother with their subscription. Get Amazon Prime instead; it's a much better deal.",

So unless the customer go out of their way to ask for refund, they just proceed life as it is and take people's money wrongly.",

If you're looking for quality based on my experience, when you order from official noon or other well-known sellers like supermall, the quality is perfect. Otherwise, I'd say it's usually seller based. However, the best trait of noon is their delivery service as the delivery prices are fair, and you get your items on the exact date specified or even earlier without the need for a subscription. For short, in terms of speed and quality, noon is my go-to app. 👍",
