        "content": "Love this app, but, received a coupon for 25% off premium subscription with 3 months free service, It's not stated, but the app offers additional free days, 7 after you sign up for the premium, I'm not sure if that free time is in additions, but it should be, as that is how it's advertised. I followed the link and signed up, after 7 days I was charged the full amount.  The developer did not honor the discount.  Fortunately I used PayPal and will initiate a dispute, if it can't be resolved, I will have to look for another app, or go without. I'm not going to support a dishonest developer. And neither should anyone else.  Response to:\"Unfortunately, we're not able to honor discounts on in-app purchases..\"  Was not an in-app purchase. It was an email offer from the dev, offered before I activated the free 7 day premium service.  I followed the link while using my desktop email program, followed the directions and ended up getting charged full amount, then told that I didn't follow the directions. Instead of honoring the discount THEY refunded my money and cancel my subscription. Not the response I was expecting considering the intent of their app,  bottom line, they don't care.",

However, there are significant drawbacks: - Can't filter workouts based on body area, even doing a standalone workout outside personalised program. - Future workouts are influenced by workout and rating but if forgot, can't go back to rate. - Language is sometimes Portuguese, sometimes English. Can't recommend to English friends.",

I like the drum machine because I don't play drums. the only thing it needs is more time signatures. it currently doesn't have 7/8 time signatures and that makes it hard to record a lot of my guitar riffs that would be in 7/8. so PLEASE ADD 7/8 PLEEEASE. other than that, I'm happy with it. also please explain why metal doesn't show up on the explore page just like other genres.",

My best guess is it has to do with all the updates, which make the app better for most, but for some of us.. not so much. Guess I'm gonna have to update my phone and Chromebook if I want to keep using it the way I used to (without lack, live and in recordings. Clicking noise and stuttering and desynchronized monitoring after like a minute. It was fun while it lasted).",

It's one of the best features, creating my own drumkits with the sampler was fun but after using Bandlab for 3 years they make me pay for it.

I love how you can record your own music and add it in to your songs, and how you can adjust each part's volume and everything! The one and only problem I have is that the songs I've already made and saved to my account aren't able to be automatically transferred when I switch devices. I had to redo my favorite songs all the way just to transfer them between devices. I don't tend to upload a lot of my songs, but I would REALLY appreciate it if my songs could automatically transfer between devices when linked to my account. I feel that I've lost a lot of my good projects because of this. Please fix and I'll give this app the 5 stars it really deserves!",

My only con I have is that I wish the android version could port all of the packs you own to the Windows version, so you don't have to buy on separate platforms for packs and can use both programs with the many amounts of choices. 2016: I posted a previous review about a negative crashing error a week ago. That review was not accurate. I have been using this software for about 4 months now. And I really like it on Android but LOVE it on Windows. I have made probably about 3 albums worth of music from this software and there are so many expansion packs to choose from.

[First] I downloaded this app thinking I could make music and then access the music that I just made. However there are extreme limitations on the access you have to the music that you made due to the packs that you use. I was frustrated when I went to download the music and access the music for my personal files, that is when I found out that I was not able to do that. You see each music pack seems to have different rights and privileges for the user, whether or not they can or cannot access the music outside of the app or outside of the app's music community which was a big disappointment. [Second] your creativity is capped you are only allowed to use samples of created music you're not allowed to design or setup your own music, beats or instruments patterns. That too was a disappointment. aside from those issues the app has brought me some level of entertainment although it didn't last very long.",

I totally recommend this app to anyone new to DJing or simply interested in making music through the mixing/layering of samples. Tons of sample packs to choose from to create hours and hours of awesome music! I totally love it!",

The main issue is assigning two or more deliveries to one person, which delays pickup and drops, leaving food cold and customers deprioritized. On top of that, delivery times keep getting extended after the order is placed. Please focus on timely service over cost-cutting.",

The app is very easy to use, you do pay more for some items than you would in the store, but that is the cost of convience. 9/11/24 UPDATE: I recently notice that when I order heavy items the female shoppers will mark them as not available, even when the item is available. I feel like some of them don't want to lift the heavy items. I'm ready to stop using instacart. I wish I could choose male shopper for my order",

On top of that it ask for additional tips for doing the service you pay for originally. Dont add anything once you order they charge a fee for adding to the list even if its at the same store but get this they encourage you to add forgotten items then charge you. I'm just doing what I have to to survive or I wouldn't mention Instacart",

I'm going to have to turn off notifications entirely, which defeats the purpose of the app in the first place... so that probably means I'll end up just deleting the app entirely.",

They are just white, wich can be hard to see what kind of weather it is sometimes. Would be good to have at least an option to choose between a colored or a white comp.",

Certainly, it could be the age of my phone, but all the same Google's app says it's using the exact location causing many past online address registration failures. I like it 😀",

Airline prices are extremely volatile and you can find an excellent deal, but by the time you click on it, it's gone and the price might double in that minute or so that passed, which I find infuriating. Good app, I have been experiencing lots of errors though. I click on view deal and the page won't load or it will say error.",

Each game is only about 30 seconds long so this all is essentially 50% watching ads.

Especially if you're planning on taking out a large amount. It'll take a whole week before you get your money. PayPal savings has similar rates, and withdrawals in half the time Betterment does.",

For example, Canva can edit the background and foreground separately, remove objects, expand the image, etc. Other than that, the tools the app offers are still some of the best out there for free.",

It would be nice & help if you could organize our subscriptions list back in alphabetical order again instead of having them all scrambled up with no organization to them. It takes forever to scroll through them to find a certain channel you are subscribed to. You can alphabetize them in YouTube on your computer but not on your Android TV App. Makes no sense. How hard is it to write code to fix this. It use to be alphabetized but after an update it went away. Please fix.",
