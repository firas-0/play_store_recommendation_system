Or app could make some of the games open for free, always, so we could try. I hate my time wasted by bait and switch tactics. If I can give a -1 star, I would. UPDATE: Fair dev response and I upped my rating. Maybe it was me, but I saw no way to get to the free games. Everything was locked. I'll try again if I get time.",

My Glovo order got cancelled twice due to a “technical issue.” I waited a long time each time, and by the time I was notified, it was too late to order from anywhere else. This is not the first time this happens. Very unreliable service and zero respect for the customer’s time. Glovo needs to fix these technical issues and improve communication.",

Please take a look at this asap, as it's making our Prime subscription pointless, if we can never order when we want, at times that we know for sure the stores are open.",

        "content": "The most bizarre data storage model I've ever seen - messages *are* stored on their servers, I know because they're delivered if I was offline for a while, but every message is kept in my device's persistent data storage (as opposed to cache storage), so after a few months of use, LINE had consumed over 2.5GB of my device storage. And clearing the app's data on my phone apparently deleted (my copy of) all of those messages from LINE's servers as well, because afterwards all of my chats were still there, but were completely blank, with no way to recall the prior messages. For comparison, my 8 other chat apps *combined* use just under 1GB of storage. Spammy with ads for IAPs (stickers, themes, etc.). Default notification setting is set to \"annoying and obtrusive\" mode - big floating pop-up, even turns on screen if off. Weird interface makes it hard to find some settings - they're not all found in one place. Account is linked to a physical device, not to a username and password. Sure, you can *add* a username/password to allow you to access your chats (on ONE computer only), but if you get a new phone, or factory reset your current phone, there's no way to reconnect it to your existing account, you have to create a new one. Want to use LINE on a tablet without telephony? Good luck. All of these design decisions make no sense to me. Only reason for giving two stars instead of one is that the app does work, for the basic purpose of sending & receiving messages.",

    "description": "<b>Camera FV-5</b> is a professional camera application for mobile devices, that puts DSLR-like manual controls in your fingertips. Tailored to enthusiast and professional photographers, with this camera application you can capture the best raw photographs so that you can post-process them later and get stunning results. The only limit is your imagination and creativity!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Major features:</b>\r\n\r\n● All photographic parameters are adjustable and always at hand: exposure compensation, ISO, light metering mode, focus mode, white balance and program mode.\r\n● DSLR-like viewfinder display: see exposure time, aperture and stops display with EV and bracketing settings, in real-time!\r\n● Full fledged exposure bracketing: from 3 to 7 frames, unlimited stops spacing, plus custom EV shifting.\r\n● Built-in intervalometer: make stunning timelapses (even bracketed/HDR timelapses) and time-controlled picture series.\r\n● Program and Speed-priority modes.\r\n● Long exposure support: take beautiful night photos and light trails with long exposure times up to 30 seconds**.\r\n● JPEG, true 16-bit RAW in DNG format*, and lossless PNG photo capturing formats, perfect for post-processing.\r\n● Manual shutter speed: from 1/80000 to 2\", or the range available on your device*.\r\n● All camera functions assignable to volume keys. You can adjust EV, ISO, color temperature and more using volume keys. Devices with hardware camera shutter key are also supported.\r\n● EXIF and XMP sidecar metadata support.\r\n● Autofocus, macro, touch-to-focus, true manual focus* and infinity focus modes. Autofocus lock feature (AF-L).\r\n● Autoexposure (AE-L) and auto white balance (AWB-L) locks in Android 4.0+.\r\n● In background photo and RAW developing and processing allows a smooth, uninterrupted camera operation.\r\n● Digital zoom using multitouch pinch gesture.

A dark background for the icons would help see them if the picture is at all bright. Having the shutter release change the zoom is good: this way I can see the effect not my fingers. I like that the video switch is in a menu, not on the viewfinder where it's too easy for my big finger to hit it accidentally.",

Once it had an audacity to tell me that no frames were sent for a long exposure image, so I suspect that it internally takes a series of images and coadds them, which, well, coadd the noise as well, so it is impossible to collect enough light on anything that isn't visible in the preview window. You can get star trails of the brightest stars, but any nebulosity, any faint objects, you can forget about it.  Not to mention, it is very battery hungry.",

The previous \"face\" for the investments menu was great, it was simple and basically almost all the info you needed was there. Now though, it became very daunting to visualize super simple information such as profit/loss for each one of your assets. We need to click on the asset's category, which I actually liked, but when you click and get the list of assets they no longer show profit/loss right away, you must click on a particular asset \"card\", wait a popup page to load and only then you have the information displayed. Basically you need to go back and fourth individually clicking on each one of your assets to look if you're \"making or losing money\". Another thing is, if we now have a new \"view\", which is the pop up that shows up when you click on an asset, why wasting a huge space with a massive \"Info box\" saying things like \"Profit/Loos\" and \"Average Price\" are based on the asset's value at the moment of your purchase...\". Why not just leave this info hidden on a ( ! ) small little icon-button and use that huge space to show a line graph with the change in the asset's price with a few filters like (Day) (Week) (Month) (Year) (5 Years)? Very simple changes that will add a lot of value to the platform (in my opinion). Please have a look at this and if possible, make some changes. Those were my 2 cents! Have a great one.",

Deezer has no way of viewing your library of music via genre suggestions like Spotify (that has issues in and of itself, I know). but the real dealbreaker for me is that there is no way to delete music from the currently listening to screen. I am always purging from my playlists, it is difficult to do that right now on this app.",

I am unable to pull up my phone while driving to read the message while I'm driving.

I don't even want to use it anymore. Which is a bummer because I used it every day. Users should be given a choice for how they want their score calculated/displayed.",

Also the transition was not seamless, so every 33 minutes there is a 1 second break in the video, even when trying to piece it together with video editing software. Also you are limited to 9 gigs of video (why not unlimited?). But it still resets at 3.99 gigs. This app didn't do anything better than the stock camera.",

However, there are two issues where the app falls short: One is the shutter time limitation of 0.6 s - far too short for high quality night time photography. The other is that when the camera is held upside down (which I have to do to attach it to a gimbal) the \"right handed\" menu is on the left (as is the left-handed menu). Not good. Also interval shooting is quite inaccurate.",

It just can't seem to remember the setting for my flash storage and I've taken too many pictures now where it just sends the image into nowhere land instead of saving it to my card. Too many memories lost now. That has to be the one thing that a camera app cannot fail at. The second thing is to ensure as good a picture as possible with as little input from the user as possible. All I want is a simple click and shoot and save and don't use all the fancy bells and whistles of the app.",

I also had a recording that was *way* too low and the audio was barely salvageable.

Makes no sense as that is pretty common technology. Otherwise looks like it could have been a nice app. And please, if I am just missing the voice command setting, please let me know.",

They miss many of my absolute favorites, but the ones they have are very good and we've found new favorites. And tons of audiobooks! Those are fantastic to have. However, finding all the books in a reading level is impossible, and I very much wish that was MUCH easier. I create lists myself and have found workarounds, but it's annoying and I wish we could search by reading level only.",

        "content": "I wish this app would work for us, I installed it for my kids 3 year old and 5 year old. Both are learning to read, and could not read on their own yet. The problem is, this app shows all sorts of books, and doesn't label the books according to their appropriate age category. I don't see any option for filtering the books according to age, level of difficulty, or level of reading proficiency. So finding an appropriate book to read for my preschooler is a hit and miss. Also, the read to me option is not interactive at all, its like watching a video, not a reading experience. I want my kids to be able to read along, ie they should be able to follow the reader verbatim, and then flip the page at their own pace. I guess this app is not so suitable for early readers (pre-K or grade K).",

Updates: the issue mentioned earlier I believe was due to the app used the ultra wide camera for other focal lengths by using digital zoom (without actually switching the camera)",

When the phone is unfolded although the interface is correct, the actual photos taken are rotated 90 degrees, regardless of the orientation of the phone 2. There is no way to enable 'front-camera selfie mode' All made worse by the rigid no-refund policy so zero option to try before you buy. Buyer beware!",

Rumble should have the option to continue playing while the app is in the background or the screen is off. Rumble should actually integrate with the phone where, for example, it shows up in the list of phone notifications and can be played/paused from there. Or where it can be played/paused from Bluetooth earbuds, car stereos, etc. It doesn't have any of this integration. It behaves more like a desktop application that's been cross-compiled into an App... and not actually developed as a cellphone App from the start.",

It's a loading circle, they tells me to make sure it's on the same WiFi network, then says there is nothing to cast to. I do this with YT and have no issue.",

But the update with a feature where you NEED to have muzio access your phone is too much.On top of being annoying getting a popup whenever a call ends it can be dangerous if you're driving and need maps up but you get a popup. I'm not going to always get off the road(sometimes you can't or there's no stop)to exit it and re-enter my navigation.",
