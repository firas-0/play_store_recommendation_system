For a focus app, it's extremely distracting to get a random and usually very obnoxious ad after a focus session.

It would be so nice to use the Pomodoro method with this app (that is, set 25min for focus, then 5min for rest, repeat) but the 10min minimum is too long for that. Also, it kind of defeats it's own purpose with the limited-time plants. It's gotten to the point I don't feel much use in opening it because it isn't like I can acquire any of the FOMO anyway :/",

Also, it used to let you watch an ad to get an extra life when you ran out - that's gone, too! Basically, now they force you to use up your boosters.

They made it just too hard now to get past levels without boosts or spending money. It got to the point it was no fun anymore so I decided to uninstall it. My advice is have fun until it's too hard and NEVER spend a penny on it. That's what they want you to do. Dont fall for it",

        "content": "I was perfectly content with using this app for years, then yesterday, they put up a paywall. I could no longer access my routines or stats until I subscribed. They offer a \"free four day trial\", during which you can cancel to avoid the monthly charge, as long as it's a day before the trial ends (or something like that). Well, I signed up last night and cancelled about 12 hours later, only to be told by Google that my subscription will be closed after the point where I will incur a fee. I don't mind the ads, I've happily used this app for years, but there is nothing that warrants a $5/month subscription. Edit: it appears I did NOT get charged post cancellation, yet at least. It is still disappointing to see greed take over such a great app. Uninstalling after 2+ years of regular use.",

The reason for only two stars is the ads, so many ads, and they are not just a bar on the screen. The worst ones are video ads you cannot dismiss for 10s and stop my music.",

But there's a dark side, the constant spam from fake women messaging me. I'd like to block non-contacts from messaging me, but guess what, this feature is behind paywall. It should not be, it's a security matter and in fact should be on by default. In addition to that, Telegram often fails to establish calls.",

Then, during a trip last week the app bugged me with \"Recalculating the route\" voice notifications every second when I used it on dirt roads and wouldn't follow the exact route. That was soo annoying that I had turned it off altogether and missed my turn. I realized it too late which cost me extra 2 hours of driving :((",

Hoping this can be corrected although not a major issue. Update: > The latest version as of early January 2018 caused problems on both my phone and tablet. Detailed maps disappeared and left me with only major roads. The navigation engine also seemed to have problems finding a solution for long journeys. I reverted back to the previous version and don't seem to have the same problem with street detail after clearing the app cache but routing a long journey still appears to be very slow. Otherwise still very good. < Very good in it's own right but even better when considering the functionality and cost (paid app & OSM maps here). I also use Copilot and, while it's very good as well, the map update schedule doesn't even compare. I also use the PC based version but the mobile version is much easier to use. I've seen people complain about the app and OSM maps but can't imagine why. Installing OSM maps has even added new life to several of my old Garmin handheld and mobile units. Everyone should applaud the hard work and incredible results offered to all of us by this team and those who make OSM maps available. Many here are too young to appreciate what is offered and the occasional shortcomings. Go buy a paper atlas and some gas station maps and rethink your complaints.",

I refuse to put any $ toward the games I play and the in game gear keeps steady upgrade as I level up. Only thing I would change is most of the firearms shoot automatically at the badguys. If I want to fire by myself then I must switch to my secondary weapon which is usually a sniper rifle or rocket launcher. But this game is pretty fun 😎",

I was running the dungeon, got to the part with 1-2-3-4 panels, our team was running pretty nicely, until, OF COURSE, my teamate hadn't figured out the puzzle, but I Had. Worst of all, he just kept hitting random panels whenever I would hit one. I tried shooting the panel, to tell him where to go and where to look to understand my reasoning, but he just went ahead and shot me right back just because he has no common sense. Even if he had gone to the proper panel, it's a time puzzle, we couldn't just hit them in order, we had to time them right. This is a straight deal breaker for a game like this, wth. Fix this, I'm not spending another hour in a dgn because people are stupid.",

Does not require real money to play or do well in the game, but it is difficult (not impossible) to make your avatar look cool without spending some cash.

Also would be cool to find more hidden gear chests. Maybe make it so that you have to search the map a bit more. Maps are a bit simplistic as of yet.

This is clearly a move to discourage people from reporting missing or defective items. And the support is hit or miss. Sometimes they respond quickly and issue a refund. Sometimes they blame the restaurant and do nothing at all. And we're talking about completely wrong orders (different name completely).",

Everything is at least 20% more expensive through this app than ordering through the store. Promos don't easily show up. UI can be confusing. Terrible experience.",

With selfies, in particular, it won't stop darkening and shrinking my features. It's very annoying. What gives? I think I'll stick to a more realistic, reliable and professional camera app. So much for using the lauded pixel for photography 🙄",

I always preferred zoom buttons over pinch, but now that I broke my arm I'm even more appreciative of buttons. Also, it sucks that it requires Google photos to see the pictures I took. it should just open whatever my default gallery app is.",

The best I can do (when the app works) is set it to Portrait. And even then, it's not that much better.",

However, for several months or more, it has been recording an image different from the one shown on the screen (likely it is cropping the wrong area of the image). This effectively ruins any video I take with zoom. Considering I bought the Pixel in part for the amazing camera, it puts a pretty big damper in that experience. Hope it's fixed soon 🤞",

Even after the download of videos if u lost connection it will still stop working. u can never get on screen options at once, for example to even pause a video i tap 100 times on the screen, or if u want to rewind u again tap for at least 10 times. PS: its not a problem with my phone because none of the other apps lag. i installed in other new phone its the same performance. Get a developer and fix this app",

Instead of investing in quality trainers, the company seems to prioritize hiring call center employees who create more hassle for learners.",

The jury is still out on if I'll purchase the app. The exercises are short and energizing, which is the reason I went ahead and started from day 1 again. It's a great program.

Only complaints so far is not being able to manually input/edit Calories because most of the searches I find are incorrect and the adding water intake doesn't have a custom amount option. Other than that, it gives me a rough ballpark and a good way to keep most things I track centralized. ❤️",

Some examples: - every time you start the app it pushes a full screen ad about betterme products you can buy - the steps only work by letting your phone or their own fitness tracker count them, no other device - the fasting option does not let you adjust start time (must be a bug) slightly disappointed for the money...",

You get to do what was assigned for the day OR repeat your previous workouts from the days before. I also like that I'm not doing the same routine over and over. Each workout is designed for a specific zone/zones and I don't get bored because of that. Highly recommend!",

After wasting my time trying to resolve things with you, nothing productive happened. Don't download!!",

The timing and the prompts of the exercises and the videos are completely wrong. so they'll tell you to do an exercise for 30 seconds while only allotting 15 seconds for the exercise in the video. so they just feel rushed, discordinated and not very well put together videos. and the timing thing makes absolutely no sense and is an extremely frustrating and I find absolutely no value in their videos and I'm disgusted at the price they want to charge people every 4 weeks for this",

All the workouts were built around burning calories specifically. Not worth the money",

However, my experience of their charging policy, lack of communication, poor customer service, and unwillingness to refund a monthly charge even though you attempt to cancel your subscription within 24 hours of notification of it makes this an app I would not recommend and would encourage others to avoid. It seems like their business model is to collect someone's first month's renewal before they realize it has been charged.",
