I stream live concerts and while I use 4 cameras running through an ATEM, this app allows me to use cellphones and tablets as additional wireless cameras during shows. With some tweaking, the cellphone cameras look as good and match my other cameras and because they are wireless, I don't have to worry about cable reach. Would love to be able to set color temperature as a number instead of presets, but not a big issue. I contacted the developer with an issue and received a reply very quickly.",

Additionally, only one flaw was found, which was related to uploading audio. I tried it many times with different songs, and it failed. I hope this gets fixed. I want to try this option, but it has been impossible for me to do so. 5 stars if that gets fixed.",

To me, it feels kind of like a rip-off, because you could have over 500 credits, and once your time’s up, they just reduce it back to 50.",

When I cancelled my checking acct it locked me out of the app so now I can't see how much my Amex cc is and have to blindly pay it off hoping I don't pay to much or to little. Frustrating.

One big issue is that sometimes if I haven't talked to someone in a while their profile disappears and after a while it comes back which is odd. Love all the filters, you can change the color of your text, there's no limit to how much you can change your profile picture, which is nice because I use Messenger daily. Btw I got an idea--what if you could change the background for the text chats? That'd be amazing! Thx for making this for us kids❣❤",

I am also experiencing issues as to why we cant type too long of texts. I think users should be able to write long paragraphs instead of having to do separate texts if one is too long. The last issue I'm having is with the voice messages, you see, the person that I am communicating with could have the absolute best wifi in the world and I could too but the voice chats are extremely glitchy, laggy, choppy, and sometimes freeze. But overall this a mediocre app. My parents also like the fact that they can track my activity! Maybe if you just try to make the network a little more stable and fix some bugs and issues it'll be five stars in no time but for now that's all I have to say. (But still an amazing app)",

There is the option of taking a picture, but I was trying to get a photo from my gallery for my profile picture but it doesn't work on the phone I currently have (that's android) iPhones work only.",

Its very frustrating that you cannot skip ahead to the portion of the workout that you need.

There is a new season with new opportunities of collaborations and new skins to play with every month, and there are events to keep you busy, and leaderboards! It's also possible to play without WiFi! You can still enjoy playing it, just without the online leaderboards, and ads don't work. But overall it is almost fully operational without WiFi. I really like this game, and suggest it to you.",

However, I have been disappointed at some newer changes to the game. My biggest complaint right now would be the change to the characters, and how each skin is now separate. It makes the menu really cluttered and also seems like a grab for more money from players. One of my favorite things is collecting characters, but now it is way harder to do. -Lia",

I would like to make a suggestion of adding the showdown event permanent but this time give the subway surfers powers like Jake for example can be given food powers whereby he slows down other players by throwing food at them and I'm sure I was not the only one who enjoyed this feature I hope you consider my idea and reply.

It includes modes for capturing images, videos and QR / barcode scanning along with additional modes based on CameraX vendor extensions (Portrait, HDR, Night, Face Retouch and Auto) on <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/camerax/devices\">devices where they're available</a>.\r\n\r\nModes are displayed as tabs at the bottom of the screen. You can switch between modes using the tab interface or by swiping left/right anywhere on the screen. The arrow button at the top opens the settings panel and you can close it by pressing anywhere outside the settings panel. You can also swipe down to open the settings and swipe up to close it. Outside of the QR scanning mode, there's a row of large buttons above the tab bar for switching between the cameras (left), capturing images and starting/stopping video recording (middle) and opening the gallery (right). The volume keys can also be used as an equivalent to pressing the capture button. While recording a video, the gallery button becomes an image capture button for capturing images.\r\n\r\nThe app has an in-app gallery and video player for images/videos taken with it. It currently opens an external editor activity for the edit action.\r\n\r\nZooming via pinch to zoom or the zoom slider will automatically make use of the wide angle and telephoto cameras on Pixels and other devices supporting it. It will become more broadly supported over time.\r\n\r\nBy default, continuous auto focus, auto exposure and auto white balance are used across the whole scene. Tapping to focus will switch to auto focus, auto exposure and auto white balance based on that location. The focus timeout setting determines the timeout before it switches back the default mode. The exposure compensation slider on the left allows manually tuning exposure and will automatically adjust shutter speed, aperture and ISO. Further configuration / tuning will be provided in the future.\r\n\r\nThe QR scanning mode only scans within the scanning square marked on the screen. The QR code should be aligned with the edges of the square but can have any 90 degree orientation. Non-standard inverted QR codes are fully supported. It's a very quick and high quality QR scanner able to easily scan very high density QR codes from Pixels. Every 2 seconds, it will refresh auto focus, auto exposure and auto white balance on the scanning square. It has full support for zooming in and out. The torch can be toggled with the button at the bottom center. The auto toggle at the bottom left can be used to toggle scanning for all supported barcode types. Alternatively, you can select which barcode types it should scan via the menu at the top. It only scans QR codes by default since that provides quick and reliable scanning. Most other types of barcodes can result in false positives. Each enabled type will slow down the scanning and will make it more prone to false positives especially with difficult to scan barcodes such as a dense QR code.\r\n\r\nCamera permission is the only one that's required. Images and videos are stored via the Media Store API so media/storage permissions aren't required. The Microphone permission is needed for video recording by default but not when including audio is disabled. Location permission is only needed if you explicitly enabling location tagging, which is an experimental feature.\r\n\r\nBy default, EXIF metadata is stripped for captured images and only includes the orientation. Stripping metadata for videos is planned but not supported yet. Orientation metadata isn't stripped since it's fully visible from how the image is displayed so it doesn't count as hidden metadata and is needed for proper display. You can toggle off stripping EXIF metadata in the More Settings menu opened from the settings dialog. Disabling metadata stripping will leave timestamp, phone model, exposure configuration and other metadata. Location tagging is disabled by default and won't be stripped if you enable it.",

It got to the point of 95% ads and 5% aggravating game that I kept quitting because of the ad irritation. Deleting my account now.",

Or another glitch that upsets me is when I go to use an ad to get a power up, and the game will glitch the ad and not give the reward! there's also ads after every game.",

Once I got into the app, it quickly turned into a data harvesting/don't you want all this other content too? kind of thing that puts me off.

However, with both the small cart price hiked up and the CA mandatory service fee, what should have been a $12-15 order without a small cart fee is now $20. In my opinion, I think that's way too much for an order from Wendy's for one person. Just wasted $10 on another month of unlimited, too. Very disappointed, to say the least.",

Combine this with an almost completely automated \"support team\" that rarely reads your requests to them unless you respond repeatedly to them. They have also stopped offering a delivery credit for when they screw up, which used to make up for errors IMO. Support will automatically reject any requests for a refund, even if the Postmate stomped on your food in front of you, so you'll have to enjoy getting lost in the weeds of trying to reach a human being just to NOT be charged for something you never received. Overall, unless something changes, this might be the end of the era where Postmates was the best around. Will update if I encounter further issues! UPDATE - Deleted the app and using competitors and already wish I had left sooner. Customer service could not care less that they're losing customers, ironic because I would have subscribed to Unlimited if the app didn't consistently have the issues I face every time.

So my order becomes twice the price. There is a service fee, (using the app) a delivery fee (a whopping $6) AND they raise the menu prices by a few dollars. And of course tip.

So postmates was going to over charge me by $10, plus the tip to the driver. So I saved at least $15 dollars by going myself. Might cancel my subscription now.",

Not to mention it just doesn't work on lockscreen. I request developers to either fix the remote or bring back the old one.",

The virtual Chromecast remote, bundled within this app, swipe pad used to work great but now it registers swipes as clicks in YouTube so it doesn't work at all. I think Google's engineers use iPhones because that's the only explanation for how this issue has been present for more than a few days.",

No haptic feedback unless swiping on the pad and the centre button to select doesn't work in either swipe or d-pad mode. Only works randomly, despite rebooting or resetting. Horrendous! You have ruined a previously essential feature and made it impossible to use! Only workaround is to uninstall update & now works perfectly again in the previous better format.",
