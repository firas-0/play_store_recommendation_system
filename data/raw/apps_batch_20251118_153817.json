Thank you again to the support team for trying to help, though.",

I could maybe see them having an auto pick option to make things easy, but there no way to keep your money from going to companies that you don't like, or companies whose stocks are actually failing. Even after you pause transfers, it still takes money from your account, it just takes it from only automatic withdrawals like a Spotify subscription. I guess they don't want you to notice, but I guess LEGALLY it's not stealing.",

I have not spent a single penny and the progression still feels great, but it does slow down a bit when you get into the super high levels as you need lots of materials to upgrade stuff. All ads are optional which is always great, and there is a decent amount of stuff to do each day. The only really problem that exists is the super unbalanced enemy modifiers that make the game super unfun sometimes.",

My advice, find a loadout you're best at and stick with it. Change it only when needed. Great game you guys!",

Even basic loot chests can't be opened immediately without viewing an ad or two, which, 9 times out of 10, is for Mistplay. Loot drops in-game are ultra low-quality and minimal at best, as is cash and other items necessary for equipment and character upgrades. And as far as the game's premium currency goes, you won't find less bang for your buck. Incredibly disappointing, because it could be a great game.",

If you skip watching the adds, the bonuses plummet and it will take you the next year to level up. The cost of chests, gems, items, etc. is also extremely expensive.",

When I contacted support, they just raised a ticket and assured me it would be resolved in 3 hours, but even after a week, nothing was done. To make it worse, they closed the ticket without informing me, and my refund is still pending. Very poor and unprofessional service — completely 😞😞😞",

It seems like they have very little control over the operators listed on their platform — anyone can register a bus without proper checks. There’s no accountability for delays, poor bus conditions, or missing amenities. On top of that, many operators talk as if they’re doing passengers a favor. Overall, it feels like Redbus doesn’t verify or monitor service quality at all.",

When I reopened the ticket they stop answer the question.. worst experience..",

Hot Zone map design isn't so great (on small maps, almost every direction can be an entry point into the zone). Also, may as well add a deathmatch or FFA. 3. The visual recoil in ADS is SO UGLY. Literally no point in its existence here, already enough every fully automatic gun is hard to control even with attachments",

It’s smooth even on low-end devices, no lag, no toxic players, and most importantly, no pressure. Whether I win or lose, I still enjoy every match. The controls are easy to learn, and the gameplay feels welcoming. It’s the first FPS that lets me play my way—confident, relaxed, and happy. 10/10!!",

The movie selection and tv shows are very limited and you burn through the selection very quickly. The comic selection is also lacking. If it's a monthly subscription I would hope I could read new comics that come out, but they dont add hardly any of them. Comics, TV shows and movies are rotated out which doesn't make any sense to me since it's their media on their app with their brand. I'd say to wait until they've added more.",

First, on my tablet (Galaxy Tab S3), it forces landscape mode to browse menus. Which is quite annoying. Once I'm into the book or show, I can flip orientation and it's fine. But I have to browse the menus in landscape. I would far prefer using portrait mode here. It would be SUPER awesome to be able to download multiple entries in a series at once, rather than one at a time. For example, I'm reading The Long Halloween, and I like to read offline quite a bit. I would love to be able to just download the whole series, or maybe check off a few at a time and download them all at once. Other than that, I'm very much enjoying DCU!",

They have 5 times the content. Never had a streaming issue either. Plays smooth and love it. Watch on TV, Phone, Tablet etc. Plus they just added a lot more comics",

This review is to see if it's a phone model issue or an app issue, as I've also reinstalled multiple times. I love this app, and understand if it just isn't compatible!",

The credit builder card is phenomenal, and I adore it. However, I would love to see it report to all 3 major credit bureaus instead of just Transunion. It's a great app & bank!",

Additionally, the game features the now common gambling lootbox mechanics, where most premium tanks that you don't have to pay money for are found. The game has a strong foundation, but suffers from predatory monetization, despite what wargaming claims. I say all of this as someone who's played the game for 8 years.",

        "content": "The game is excellent and addictive. I have been playing for several years now and still enjoy getting into a battle. It is heated, meaning learn the lower levels before going to a higher level to just because you get a bigger tank. Lower tiered tanks are amazing to fight in, but it allows a player to hone skills need for the higher levels. I do love the game. I play this one game more than anything else. Sit back maneuver and destroy the enemy teams tanks. Enjoy! Straight up! There really is only one issue I have and I consider it to be extremely frustrating as well as other players. WOT tank merely gives generic answers which is like duh, but do not address the issue. Your play style is dialed in, meaning you you consistently high on the points leader board for scoring points. However at certain points of playing you will find yourself in a tailspin spiraling down in stats. When you look at your opposing team their skill set is at a higher level than the teammates you have. Your team can be at an of say 45% with most players having less than a 1000 games under their belt, but your opposing team is at a 54% win rate overall 10,000 plus games. The opposing team has the upper hand. Now WOT will merely brush it aside rather than address the issue. There was a time when games were better matched, but however when you have losing streaks of fifteen or twenty games with one win it is definitely annoying. There was a time when WOT would not allow new players to enter into higher matched games, but they have been for the last couple of years. My hope is they address this problem rather than spinning it. They should be able to take players at various skill sets or tiers and advance them accordingly. Its an algorithm problem, but I do not know why they continually ignore the problem.I have brought it up in their help desk forum, but I merely get generic response. We will see what happens.

At times, the struggle is real, and even the app gives up, just loads, and nothing comes up. Then you have to shut the whole app & start again. 🙄",

For 4 days they kept calling asking for my location, I shared it every time, then they disappeared—no delivery, no answers. When I asked for a refund, they told me I must “refuse the delivery” to get my money back. How can I refuse something never delivered? Feels like a scam. They take your money and vanish. dont order if you dont wanna loose still didn't get it !!",

Outside of the load time when you die takes about 30 seconds which takes away from the play time instead of automatically spawning, instead of a time limit for a team to get a certain amount of kills. It's just that.. okay. Nothing great. Nothing that I could see myself continually playing because the speed of this game is very very slow, which in turn makes it really really boring. Not to mention as well. It takes about TWO hours just to make enough money to buy a gun which most of them cost GOLD to do so. And once you run out of gold the game FORCES you to buy it, otherwise you will continue to stay stuck playing with really advanced players that have much better guns due to them buying the gold to get better guns Oh and in order to upgrade the gun you really can't. The game will give you only one upgrade point to upgrade your gun and when you spend it, it may be a successful upgrade or it may be unsuccessful. Which if it isn't successful, then it will ask you if you want to spend 130 gold to try again. Honestly guys it's just not worth it. If you want something challenging, this game isn't it. If you want to play a game that won't cheat you this game isn't it. If you want to watch a 45 second ad to earn gold or money lol this game seriously isn't it. The glitching of the game alone will have you very upset then you have cheating players from across the world that knows how to hack into the game. For instance someone on your team will send you a message that says hacked and then they will kill you but you can't kill them because... You are team mates.. The game HAD potiental.

Plus, lot of P2W involved after reaching a certain point.That kinda set that game aside from the truly good ones. Yeah, this one is actually worse. I've seen prices for weapons that put quite the hole in your wallet. Spawns are bad. Ads are bad. Seriously, are you guys at Azur even trying to make this game good?",

Due to a recent problem with the server provider, there were synchronization errors and “match full” errors in the game. Unfortunately, this was an external issue and not related to our team.
